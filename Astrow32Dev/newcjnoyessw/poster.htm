<H2>A Program to Manage File and Picture Uploads
for Yahoo Groups</h2>

<P><B><h2>What this Program Does</H2></B><BR>
People who wish to upload a lot of material to picture collections
and file collections on Yahoo groups may find this a tedious activity.
Yahoo has no bulk upload facility for files and you can only upload
one file at a time. With Pictures Yahoo's Bulk upload program
is buggy when working with large directories and very tedious
to get through the files and directories that you may have, and
it misses files. Uploads also fail due to server problems.</P>

<P>This program helps to deal with these issues.<BR>
It allows you to select a number of files by pointing, clicking,
previewing and uploading them at one time. There is no limit to
how many files you can upload, the limit is your file or picture
allocation on yahoo, but one should upload no more than 100 pictures
to a picture directory.</P>

<P>It has some limitations.<BR>
It will not work in a group that has advertising at the top part
of the screen.<BR>
It can not manage your login/password screen, you must enter that
manually.<BR>
It can not manage the age restricted screen verifying you are
18 in adult groups, all you have to do here is click on the ok
button.<BR>
If an upload fails it will continue past it, you need to review
the files or pictures that actually made it and resubmit if there
was a problem.<BR>
Folders must already exist to use them.</P>

<P>This program is available on a shareware basis. You are allowed
60 startups witout registration after which you must register.</P>

<P>Registration is $29 U.S. and gets you the continued use of
the program and fixes and support for 2 years.</P>
