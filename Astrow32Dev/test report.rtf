\ql\fs24 {\cf2\f1\b\qc\fs30 YOUR SUN:\par}\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 Your transiting Sun is on the cusp BetweenLibra and Virgo, 
1.14 Degrees, and is in Direct motion.\par
\ql\fs24        The Sun is the source of all energies. The 
transiting Sun stimulate the activities of the houses 
occupied by the Sun and reinforce or weaken the planetary 
effects, depending on the natal aspects. When the Sun 
transits an inner planet, it may trigger a dormant aspect 
between that inner planet and a slower moving outer 
planet. The Sun spends about one month in each natal 
house.\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 Your transiting Sun is in Your Natal First House, Not On 
House Cusp and Less Important.\par
\ql\fs24        You feel an upsurge in self-confidence. This is the 
time to impress others. It is also the time to take stock 
of your self-improvement program.\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 {\cf1\b ASPECTS:}\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 Your Transiting Sun is Sextile to Your Natal Saturn With an 
Orb of 0 Degrees (Exact Orb).\par
\ql\fs24        This is the time to take care of those jobs that 
require self-discipline and attention to details.\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 {\cf2\f1\b\qc\fs30 YOUR MOON:\par}\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 Your transiting Moon is Gemini, 19.4 Degrees, and is in 
Direct motion.\par
\ql\fs24        The effects of the transiting Moon, as it makes 
aspects with your natal planet positions, are often felt 
for only a matter of hours. Regardless of whether you are 
consciously aware of them, you will feel the effects of 
the Moon. The Moon spends about two and a half days in 
each house. This means that its effects occur so quickly 
that you feel them more as unconscious urges and impulses 
than as conscious reactions to Situations.\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 Your transiting Moon is in Your Natal Tenth House, Not On 
House Cusp and Less Important, Intercepted.\par
\ql\fs24        Here's your chance to show the boss what you can 
really do. The stage is set to help you pass the test. But 
only if you have prepared for it.\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 {\cf1\b ASPECTS:}\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 Your Transiting Moon is Squared to Your Natal Ascendant 
With an Orb of 0 Degrees (Exact Orb).\par
\ql\fs24        This transit produces conflict between your will and 
your subconscious conditioning, bringing emotional 
difficulties in self-expression.\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 {\cf2\f1\b\qc\fs30 YOUR MERCURY:\par}\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 Your transiting Mercury is Libra, 6.15 Degrees, and is in 
Direct motion.\par
\ql\fs24        The planet Mercury effects your mental outlook, 
communications with others, and urges to take trips. When 
Mercury is in retrograde motion during its transit, it may 
introduce delays in the affairs under its influence. 
Mercury spends about a week in each house.\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 Your transiting Mercury is in Your Natal First House, Not 
On House Cusp and Less Important.\par
\ql\fs24        Your mind is sharp today. Now is a good time to take 
on that difficult project.  However, you may have trouble 
keeping focused on one thing.\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 {\cf1\b ASPECTS:}\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 Your Transiting Mercury is Sextile to Your Natal Mercury 
With an Orb of 1 Degrees.\par

and communicate those plans to others. Take a short trip.\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 Your Transiting Mercury is Conjunct to Your Natal Mars With 
an Orb of 0 Degrees (Exact Orb).\par
\ql\fs24        You don't have the mental stamina to work all night 
or to argue all day. You don't do either. Save your 
energy.\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 Your Transiting Mercury is Conjunct to Your Natal Neptune 
With an Orb of 0 Degrees (Exact Orb).\par
\ql\fs24        Your mind seems to be fascinated with some elusive 
ideas. Keep your imagination from running wild.\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 {\cf2\f1\b\qc\fs30 YOUR VENUS:\par}\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 Your transiting Venus is Scorpio, 14.25 Degrees, and is in 
Direct motion.\par
\ql\fs24        Venus is the planet of love and material pleasures, 
so that its transits bring different degrees of enjoyment. 
The effects are felt as subjective experiences rather than 
as urges to action. Venus is in retrograde motion for 
about one and a half months each year. During that time 
the affairs affected by Venus may be slowed down or 
delayed. Venus is in each house for about three months.\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 Your transiting Venus is in Your Natal Third House, On 
House Cusp and More Important.\par
\ql\fs24        Your contacts with family and friends become more 
pleasant as you turn from serious matters to social 
pleasantries. You may enjoy a short trip.\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 {\cf2\f1\b\qc\fs30 YOUR MARS:\par}\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 Your transiting Mars is Taurus, 22.56 Degrees, and is in 
Direct motion.\par
\ql\fs24        Mars provides you with the energies needed to assert 
yourself in the pursuit of your needs and desires. 
Transiting Mars is retrograde for about three months each 
year. During that time you may experience reversals and 
delays in the affairs affected by Mars in that time. The 
Planet Mars spends about two months in each natal house.\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 Your transiting Mars is in Your Natal Ninth House, Not On 
House Cusp and Less Important.\par
\ql\fs24        You feel the need to take a broader look at life, 
and your role in it.  Your need for an expanded view may 
give you the urge to take a long trip abroad.\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 {\cf2\f1\b\qc\fs30 YOUR JUPITER:\par}\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 Your transiting Jupiter is Libra, 23.8 Degrees, and is in 
Direct motion.\par
\ql\fs24        Transiting Jupiter opens you up to expansive 
feelings and triggers new opportunities to enlarge the 
scope of your life. Jupiter is in each house for about one 
year. It becomes retrograde for about four months each 
year, in which time the affairs of Jupiter will be delayed 
and reversed.\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 Your transiting Jupiter is in Your Natal Second House, Not 
On House Cusp and Less Important.\par
\ql\fs24        This time is good for business and finances. This 
would be a good time to apply for a loan, and you might 
get it right now. You will also tend to be more generous 
financially right now as well.\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 {\cf1\b ASPECTS:}\par

\ql\fs24 Your Transiting Jupiter is Conjunct to Your Natal Jupiter

that you have been working on. You are interested in 
understanding cultural trends. This is a good time to deal 
with churches, hospitals and institutions.\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 {\cf2\f1\b\qc\fs30 YOUR SATURN:\par}\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 Your transiting Saturn is Leo, 8.17 Degrees, and is in 
Direct motion.\par
\ql\fs24        Transiting Saturn brings opportunities to learn  
self-discipline and how to face responsibilities in the 
areas of  life it touches in each house. The difficulties 
that arise during a transit offer you the best 
opportunities to grow wiser as you grow older. Saturn is 
in each house for about two and a half years, and is 
retrograde for four and a half month, during which time 
its effects will be delayed and slowed down.\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 Your transiting Saturn is in Your Natal Eleventh House, Not 
On House Cusp and Less Important.\par
\ql\fs24        You are involved with serious or professional groups 
of people or organizations during this transit. This is a

scholarly works. You may put energy into humanitarian, 
occult or professional areas and become involved with 
older more established friends and acquaintances.\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 {\cf1\b ASPECTS:}\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 Your Transiting Saturn is Conjunct to Your Natal Mercury 
With an Orb of 0 Degrees (Exact Orb).\par
\ql\fs24        You are more careful now about attending to the 
details that you normally overlook. A friend may leave 
now.\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 Your Transiting Saturn is Sextile to Your Natal Neptune 
With an Orb of 1 Degrees.\par
\ql\fs24        This is a good transit to explore your subconscious, 
your psyche, your memory. Use these insights to improve 
the present. This is a good time to use meditation and 
visualization. Use your past experiences to improve your 
present.\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 {\cf2\f1\b\qc\fs30 YOUR URANUS:\par}\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 Your transiting Uranus is Pisces, 7.53 Degrees, and is in 
Retrograde motion.\par
\ql\fs24        Transiting Uranus brings major changes in your life. 
It breaks up the rigid past and challenges you to put the 
pieces together into a more practical pattern for living 
in the present. Uranus is in each natal house for about 
seven years. It is retrograde for about five months each 
year, in which time the affairs being affected will be 
delayed or reversed.\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 Your transiting Uranus is in Your Natal Sixth House, Not On 
House Cusp and Less Important.\par
\ql\fs24        This transit of Uranus Through your fifth house 
causes you to have eccentric tastes in diet and dress. 
Your work conditions may be unusual at this time.\par
\ql\fs24        During this transit, you may become vulnerable to 
freak accidents or sudden and unusual illnesses, such as 
hives and rashes. The risk is greatest when Uranus is in 
conjunction with Mars or Mercury in the Sixth House.\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 {\cf2\f1\b\qc\fs30 YOUR NEPTUNE:\par}\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 Your transiting Neptune is Aquarius, 15.5 Degrees, and is 
in Retrograde motion.\par
\ql\fs24        Transiting Neptune brings opportunities for 
discovery and use of your creative abilities in the areas 
affected by the house it occupies.  Unfortunately it also 
blurs your ability to distinguish between reality and 
illusion in those same areas. Perhaps because it energizes 
your sixth sense or psychic abilities. Neptune is in each 
house for about fourteen years, and Is retrograde for 
about five months each year, in which time the affairs 
being affected will be delayed or reversed.\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 Your transiting Neptune is in Your Natal Fifth House, Not 
On House Cusp and Less Important.\par
\ql\fs24        This transit of Neptune through your fifth house 
causes inspiration in art and music and maybe an ideal 
romance. You fantasize about romance a lot at this time. 
You are able to express yourself creatively and 
artistically at this time. There is the danger of unwanted 
pregnancy, or drug or alcohol abuse during this time 
though.\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 {\cf2\f1\b\qc\fs30 YOUR PLUTO:\par}\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 Your transiting Pluto is Sagittarius, 21.57 Degrees, and is 
in Direct motion.\par
\ql\fs24        Transiting Pluto brings down the established order 
in the affairs of the house that it occupies, and then 
creates the conditions from which new beginnings can 
emerge. You will experience major transformations in the 
areas affected by the house occupied by a transiting 
Pluto. Pluto spends about twenty years in each natal 
house, and is in retrograde motion for around five months 
each year, during which time the affairs being affected 
will be delayed or reversed.\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 Your transiting Pluto is in Your Natal Fourth House, Not On 
House Cusp and Less Important.\par
\ql\fs24        Pluto transiting through your fourth house brings 
about changes in your home life. You may need to 
reevaluate your home life and make changes in it. This is 
a good time to make changes around the house. Financial 
concerns regarding your family are important.\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 {\cf1\b ASPECTS:}\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 Your Transiting Pluto is Sextile to Your Natal Jupiter With 
an Orb of 1 Degrees.\par
\ql\fs24        This transit gives you a more positive mental 
outlook. It also increases your interest in spiritual 
self-improvement. This may bring to the surface latent 
psychic abilities. It is a good time to work on furthering 
your education in law, science or religion.\par
\ql\fs24 \par
\ql\fs24 Your Transiting Pluto is Opposition to Your Natal Uranus 
With an Orb of 0 Degrees (Exact Orb).\par
\ql\fs24        This transit may bring about your elimination of old 
and useless conditions in your life and you may make 
drastic changes. You may need to rethink your goals at 
this time, and this transit may bring new awarenesses. You 
may develop revolutionary sentiments and a desire to 
overthrow. Your normal affairs may be disrupted by events 
beyond your control. Old friendships and group 
affiliations may end and new ones may start. Psychic 
experimentation is not safe at this time. There is the 
danger of power struggles at this time.\par
