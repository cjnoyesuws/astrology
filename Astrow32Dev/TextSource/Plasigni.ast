[Signs, the Ancient History:]

     When the ancients noticed the planets moving along the ecliptic path, they also noticed the background of fixed stars behind that path. It would be as though you noticed a background of billboards around a racetrack. You could tell the positions of the horses around the track just by identifying the billboards behind each horse. The ancients used the background of fixed stars the same way. They divided their racetrack (the ecliptic) into 12 equal sectors. Each sector was named after the fixed-star group seen in that sector. Aries the ram, etc. The ancients referred to these sectors as the "little zoo", which in Greek is "zodiac".

[The Significance of The Signs:]

     The planets represent the energies that drive your physical, emotional mental and intuitional systems. These energies manifest themselves differently depending on the positions of the planets in the signs of the zodiac. Different signs channel the energies into different behavior patterns, which are then recognized as personality traits. In a word the traits associated with each sign are as follows:
TABS|60|4|5|21|38|52|
 |{Aries}|Outgoing|{Taurus}|Conservative
 |{Gemini}|Versatile|{Cancer}|Emotional
 |{Leo}|Authoritative|{Virgo}|Exacting
 |{Libra}|Helpful|{Scorpio}|Determined
 |{Sagittarius}|Optimistic|{Capricorn}|Cautious
 |{Aquarius}|Independent|{Pisces}|Impressionable

     Every sign falls into a group of signs, either fire, earth, water, and air; depending on their orientation in the zodiac. These ancient astrologers had associated each <Element> with their temperaments, and each group of elements are at 120 degree angles to each other.
TABS|66|2|3|12|
{Fire Signs:}||Aries, Leo, Sagittarius.
|Enthusiastic, courageous, passionate and impulsive.
{Earth Signs:}||Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn.
|Practical, materialistic, conservative, and inhibited.
{Air Signs:}||Gemini, Libra, Aquarius.
 |Intellectual, adaptive, impractical, and superficial.
{Water Signs:}||Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces.
 |Emotional, sensitive, placid, and susceptible.

     These four groups of signs: fire, earth, air, and water, combine to form two major groups that represent two fundamental approaches to life; active and passive. The fire and air signs make up the active or masculine signs, while the earth and water signs make up the passive or feminine signs. It is unfortunate that the ancient astrologers called the active signs masculine and the passive signs feminine. 
     Another group of traits occurs among signs that are 90 degrees apart from each other. There are four signs in each group of <Qualities>, which are cardinal, fixed, or mutable. They suggest the basic kinds of activity a person will be engaged in--getting things started, keeping them going, or steering them in different directions.
TABS|66|2|3|15|
{Cardinal Signs:}||Aries, Cancer, Libra, Capricorn.
 |Initiating, enterprising, ambitious, domineering.
{Fixed Signs:}||Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius.
 |Determined, conventional, organizing, dogmatic.
{Mutable Signs:}||Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius.
 |Adaptable, imaginative, tutorial, critical.
