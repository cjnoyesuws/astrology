[The Planets and Astrology:]

     Astrology deals with ten planets. Eight of these are the sister planets of the earth: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. The other two are the Sun and the Moon, neither of which is a planet. (A planet circles the Sun.) However, as seen from the earth, the Sun and Moon follow the same path as the planets. Astrologers, interested in the relationships between the positions of all ten objects, simply call them the <Ten Planets>, and that's what we will call them.
     The path followed by the ten planets is called the ecliptic. You can visualize the ecliptic by imagining yourself looking out from a glass-enclosed observation tower located at the center of a giant circular racetrack. The tower represents the earth. The racetrack represents the ecliptic.
     As you look out from your tower, you see all ten planets moving around the track in the same direction, from the right to your left. Since the planets move at different speeds, they are all spread out around the track. Faster planets circle the track several times a year, overtaking and passing slower moving planets that take centuries to make one lap.
     Astrologers are interested in where each planet can be found on the track, and where they are with respect to each other. They use the signs of the zodiac to describe planet positions, and <Aspects> to describe the relations between them.
     Planets represent different cosmic forces that affect your basic character traits and your changing urges and needs. They provide the energies that drive your physical, emotional, and mental and intuitional systems. These planetary energies are modified by the planet's position in the zodiac, and by its relationships (aspects) to the other planets.
    Planets fall into three groups according to how long it takes them to make one trip around the track. The first group of planets takes less than two years to make a full cycle. These include the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, and Mars. Since we experience the influence of these planetary cycles so often, we soon learn to recognize and control our reactions to them. These are the <Personal Planets>. The key characterizations from them are as follows:
TABS|60|2|15|45|

{Sun}|Identity, Purpose|(individuality)
{Moon}|Feeling, responsiveness|(Personality)
{Mercury}|Intellect, Communication|(Mentality)
{Venus}|Attraction, Harmony|(Affection)
{Mars}|Energy, Assertion|(Initiative)

     The second group of planets includes planets Jupiter and Saturn. Their effects are felt more as long-term inner urges rather than immediate conscious needs. These urges determine how you view the world.

{Jupiter}|Enthusiasm, Adventurousness|(Expansive)
{Saturn}|Caution, Restraint|(Conservative)

     The third group of planets moves so slowly that its energies influence entire generations in essentially the same, setting the culture tones for long periods of time. Uranus makes a full cycle in about 84 years, a full lifetime, while Neptune and Pluto take about two centuries (164 and 247 years respectively). The characteristics of these <Transpersonal planets> are as follows:

{Uranus}|Independent, Intuitional|(Originality)
{Neptune}|Inspirational, Mystical|(Sensitivity)
{Pluto}|Regeneration, Obsession|(Control)

     The influences of these transpersonal planets will vary between Individuals, depending on how they relate to the other planets of the horoscope, and how they fall into a person's natal houses.
