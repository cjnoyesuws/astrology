<CENTER>The Asteroid Orbital Elements Database </CENTER></H2>
<P><FONT size=+1><B>Introduction </B></FONT>astorb.dat is an ASCII file of 
high-precision osculating orbital elements, ephemeris uncertainties, and some 
additional data for all the numbered asteroids and the vast majority of 
unnumbered asteroids (multi-apparition and single-apparition) for which it is 
possible to make reasonably determinate computations. It is currently about <!--CSize-->19.7 <!--EndCSize-->Mb in size in its compressed form 
(astorb.dat.gz), <!--USize-->72.0 <!--EndUSize-->Mb in size when decompressed 
(astorb.dat), and contains <!--Count-->269735 <!--EndCount-->orbits computed by 
me (Edward Bowell). Each orbit, based on astrometric observations downloaded 
from the <A href="http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/cfa/ps/mpc.html">Minor Planet 
Center, </A>occupies one 266-column record. 
<P><FONT size=+1><B>Special Features of astorb.dat</B></FONT> There are three 
primary differences between our database and conventional asteroid orbit files. 
</P>
<P>First, <B>we update the database daily.</B> Thus, observations in each new 
batch of Minor Planet Circulars will be used in new orbits on a monthly basis, 
and those in the Minor Planet Electronic Circulars shortly after they are 
published. Other changes, such as the addition of orbits resulting from our own 
astrometric observations and the computation of current ephemeris uncertainties, 
are being made on a quasi-daily basis. Automatic daily updates commence at 8 hr 
UT. The updating process is generally completed by 10:00 UT. On the UT date of 
full Moon, the updating process is not completed until 14 hr UT or later. </P>
<P>Second, <B>all the orbits in a given version of the file have an epoch of 
osculation near the present.</B> Consequently, the ephemerides of most 
non-Earth-approaching asteroids can be computed to arcsec accuracy or better 
within ± 50 days of the epoch using a 2-body ephemeris program. </P>
<P>Third, <B>current and future ephemeris uncertainties are given.</B> Observers 
will readily be able to estimate whether asteroids are likely to be within their 
telescopes' fields of view, and they will better be able to prioritize 
astrometric targets. </P>
<P><FONT size=+1><B>Landmarks</B></FONT> For a reverse chronological listing of 
significant changes to the database, click <A 
href="ftp://ftp.lowell.edu/pub/elgb/astorb_landmarks.html">here</A>. </P>
<P><FONT size=+1><B>Downloading astorb.dat</B></FONT> The file may be obtained 
by the following means: 
<UL>
  <LI>Get a decompressed version (astorb.dat) via ftp by clicking on <A 
  href="ftp://ftp.lowell.edu/pub/elgb/astorb.dat.gz">here</A>. The source 
  (astorb.dat.gz) is compressed but your browser should automatically decompress 
  it. If this fails, try getting the original, uncompressed version by clicking 
  <A href="ftp://ftp.lowell.edu/pub/elgb/astorb.dat">here</A>. And if this 
  fails, try ftp'ing astorb.dat to yourself using the recipe below (except type 
  "get astorb.dat" rather than "get astorb.dat.gz"). To name the file on a 
  Netscape browser, click on "File", then on "Save as", then on "OK" (the file 
  will automatically be named astorb.dat unless you choose another name at this 
  point). <BR><BR>
  <LI>If the above doesn't work or if you know someone who would like astorb.dat 
  and has ftp but not WWW access, note that the compressed version is available 
  via anonymous ftp at ftp.lowell.edu/pub/elgb/astorb.dat.gz, as are text 
  versions (astorb.txt and astorb_landmarks.txt) of astorb.html and 
  astorb_landmarks.html. Type the following commands: <BR><BR>ftp ftp.lowell.edu 
  <BR>Name: anonymous <BR>Password: <CODE>your email address</CODE> 
  <BR>ftp&gt;cd pub/elgb <BR>ftp&gt;get astorb.txt <BR>ftp&gt;get 
  astorb_landmarks.txt <BR>ftp&gt;get astorb.dat.gz <BR>ftp&gt;quit 
  <BR><BR>astorb.dat.gz has been compressed using a public-domain utility called 
  <CODE>gzip</CODE>. To decompress the file (which will result in file 
  astorb.dat), type <BR>gunzip astorb.dat.gz <BR><BR>
  <UL>
    <LI><CODE>gzip</CODE> code is available at <A 
    href="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/gzip-1.2.4.tar">prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/gzip-1.2.4.tar</A> 
    (UNIX version) and <A 
    href="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/gzip-1.2.4.msdos.exe">prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/gzip-1.2.4.msdos.exe</A> 
    (DOS version). The <CODE>gzip</CODE> software accommodates both the 
    <CODE>gzip</CODE> and the <CODE>gunzip</CODE> commands. <BR><BR>Type the 
    following commands: <BR><BR>ftp prep.ai.mit.edu <BR>Name: anonymous 
    <BR>Password: <CODE>your email address</CODE> <BR>ftp&gt;cd pub/gnu 
    <BR>ftp&gt;get gzip-1.2.3.tar (or get gzip-1.2.4.msdos.exe) <BR>ftp&gt;quit 
    <BR><BR></LI></UL>
  <LI>Tell your colleagues lacking both web and ftp access that we can supply 
  them with a compressed copy of the file along with the decompression software, 
  preferably on 3.5-in (9-cm) diskettes, in either UNIX or DOS format. To 
  arrange delivery, email us at <A 
  href="mailto:koehn@lowell.edu">mailto:koehn@lowell.edu</A>or call Bruce Koehn 
  at +1-520-774-3358 (fax +1-520-774-6296), specifying the medium and format you 
  prefer. </LI></UL>
<P></P>
<P><FONT size=+1><B>Incremental update files</B></FONT> In response to users who 
have difficulty downloading the complete astorb.dat (see above for 
instructions), we have instituted (9 October 1996) a method of logging daily 
changes in the orbital elements therein. Users will find files such as 
yymmdd.add and yymmdd.del in our public ftp area accessible from the WWW. These 
cover update activities for the past 30 days or more. Thus, 961007.add comprises 
records for asteroids whose orbital elements were either added to or replaced in 
astorb.dat on 7 October 1996; and 960930.del contains records for asteroids 
whose orbits were deleted from astorb.dat on 30 September 1996. Note the 
following: (1) The *.add files are refreshed every day. Thus, an orbit that was 
replaced on, say, 961001 and then again on 961002 will be found only in the 
961002.add file on or after the latter date. (2) The *.add files reflect changes 
in orbital elements only. Changes to other parameters (such as H, G, and integer 
codes), as well as daily updates of ephemeris uncertainties, are not reported in 
the *.add files. Users who are interested in the latter should download the 
entire astorb.dat. To download the *.add and *.del files, add the commands 
<BR><BR>ftp&gt;mget *.add <BR>ftp&gt;mget *.del <BR><BR>to the ftp instructions 
above. </P>

<LI>Osculating elements [parameters (13) through (18)] are heliocentric. 
<P></P>
<P></P>
<LI>It may be assumed that ephemeris uncertainties are along the line of 
variation. Except for very accurately known orbits (ephemeris uncertainty &lt; 1 
arcsec) and very poorly known orbits (arc &lt; 10 days), positional uncertainty 
perpendicular to the line of variation is usually very small compared to that 
along the line of variation. 
<P></P>
<P></P>
<LI>The current ephemeris uncertainty [CEU, parameter (20)] and its rate of 
change [parameter (21)] indicate whether an asteroid ought to be located in an 
observer's field of view. A CEU greater than all three of the peak ephemeris 
uncertainties [PEUs, parameters (23) through (25)] implies that the asteroid's 
ephemeris uncertainty is currently greater than at any time in the next ten 
years. Such asteroids are prime targets for observation because their orbits are 
subject to the greatest improvement for years to come. Note that, because 
ephemeris uncertainties have been computed using 2-body rather than n-body error 
propagation (see <CITE>K. Muinonen and E. Bowell, Icarus <B>104</B>, 255-279, 
1993</CITE>), uncertainties for Earth-approaching asteroids may have been 
misestimated by a factor of several. 
<P></P>
<P></P>
<LI>Most single-apparition asteroids are hopelessly lost. They have large 
CEUs--typically ± 10<SUP>5</SUP> to ± 10<SUP>6</SUP> arcsec. CEUs may have been 
imperfectly computed for such asteroids (though it should hardly matter) because 
of poorly known or unknown observational accuracy and/or because orbital 
eccentricities have been assumed (integer code 2 equals 2 or 4; see the 
integer-code table above). Users who wish to estimate ephemeris uncertainties 
for lost asteroids at times close to when they were observed may make use of the 
approximate formulae (formulae require Netscape Version 2.0 or higher for proper 
rendering):

t<SUB>l</SUB> are in days); t<SUB>arc</SUB> and N are parameters (10) and (11) 
above; and <IMG alt=Delta src="Introduction to astorb_dat_files/Delta.gif" 
align=bottom> is the Earth-asteroid distance in AU. For long-unobserved 
asteroids, t<SUB>f</SUB> and t<SUB>l</SUB> may be approximated from the 
designation. Thus, for 1982 EE, which has a 9-day arc, t<SUB>f</SUB> may be 
taken as 1 March 1982 and t<SUB>l</SUB> as 15 March 1982. The formula should be 
accurate to within a factor of five. </P>
<P></P>
<LI>Peak ephemeris uncertaities [parameters (23) through (25)] generally occur 
near opposition or conjunction (the latter are more prevalent for Earth-crossing 
asteroids). The next PEU [parameter (23)] usually indicates the best time to 
make astrometric observations for orbit improvement, as will the PEU over the 
next 10 years [parameter (24)]. Special effort should be made to observe 
asteroids whose next PEUs are the greatest during the next 10 years [i.e., 
parameter (23) exceeds both parameters (24) and (25)]. Parameter (25) may be 
used to quantify the amount of orbital improvement that would result from 
observing at or near the date of next PEU. For example, if the next PEU is 
1.2D+02 arcsec, and parameter (25) has value 6.0D+00 arcsec, a 20-fold ephemeris 
improvement (and approximately equal improvement in the unceratinties of the 
orbital elements) could be made. Note that numbered asteroids whose orbits are 
satisfactory have all three PEUs less than about ± 2 arcsec (absolute). 
Consequently, numbered asteroids whose ephemeris uncertainties, as indicated by 
the CEU and PEUs, at any time exceed about 2 arcsec should be targeted for 
observation. Unnumbered asteroids whose ephemeris uncertainties [as per 
parameter (25)] could be brought below about ± 2 arcsec, would probably then be 
candidates for numbering. A parameter (25) PEU greater than a parameter (24) PEU 
implies that observing at or near the date of the next PEU [parameter (23)] may 
actually cause ephemeris and orbit degradation. Thus, there is no point in 
making such observations unless they are numerous and/or of high accuracy. 
<P></P>
<P><FONT size=+1><B>Computational Details</B></FONT> To produce the database, 
our variable-timestep differential orbit correction program was run in an 
automatic mode. Perturbation due to all major planets (Mercury through Pluto, 
Earth and Moon separately), Ceres (assumed mass 5.0×10<SUP>-10</SUP> M<IMG 
alt=_Sun src="Introduction to astorb_dat_files/smsun.gif" align=center>), Pallas 
(1.1×10<SUP>-10</SUP> M<IMG alt=_Sun 
src="Introduction to astorb_dat_files/smsun.gif" align=center>), and Vesta 
(1.4×10<SUP>-10</SUP> M<IMG alt=_Sun 
src="Introduction to astorb_dat_files/smsun.gif" align=center>) were included. 
Planetary positions were derived from JPL's DE403 planetary ephemeris. Positions 
of the three perturbing asteroids were derived, by iteration, from our own 
orbits. Relativistic effects have not been included. The orbit of one numbered 
asteroid (1566 Icarus) is known to be imperfect as it requires inclusion of 
relativistic effects. The orbits of other close-Sun-approaching asteroids are 
doubtless similarly affected, but their observational (O-C) residuals appear to 
be satisfactory. </P>
<P>For numbered asteroids, we have adopted a uniform policy regarding the 
inclusion or exclusion of observations in the orbit determination: namely, to 
exclude observations whose great-circle sky-plane residuals exceed 2.3 arcsec. 
(We have found from experience that, for well-determined orbits, 2.3 arcsec is 
an appropriate residual threshold separating "good" and "bad" observations.) For 
numbered asteroids of type 2:8 in the integer-code table above, our policy has 
resulted in degradation of the orbit-quality parameter (OQP), which is a 
reliable (logarithmic) measure of an asteroid orbit's quality, and which (for 
non-Earth approachers) correlates well with ephemeris uncertainty. Such 
asteroids need orbit improvement to the point where the exclusion of "poor" 
observations no longer degrades the OQP. For unnumbered asteroids, we have 
retained obviously inferior observations where doing so improved the OQP and 
ephemeris uncertainty, thus making it easier to reobserve them; these asteroids 
are identified by integer code 2:16. 
<P><FONT size=+1><B>Upcoming Changes in astorb.dat</B></FONT> Eventually, we 
intend to produce a version of the database in a format resembling that espoused 
in our ACM93 paper [E. Bowell, K. Muinonen, and L. H. Wasserman (1994). A 
public-domain asteroid orbit database. In <CITE>"Asteroids, Comets, Meteors 
1993" (A. Milani et al., eds.), pp. 477-481. Kluwer, Dordrecht</CITE>]. We will 
not be making this expanded file publicly accessible until we have checked it 
fairly thoroughly, incorporated it into our suite of asteroid-orbit software, 
and extracted data for a paper entitled something like <CITE>"Orbit and 
ephemeris accuracy of multi-apparition asteroids"</CITE>. </P>
<P>In addition, we are near to making a second run on orbits for numbered 
asteroids in which close asteroid-asteroid encounters will be noted and a new 
perturbation scheme that includes two or three dozen asteroid perturbers is 
implemented. </P>
<P>We are also looking into the possibility of allowing approved WWW users to 
run selected programs on our system (ephemerides; which asteroids are in a given 
region of sky at a given time; selecting subsets of asteroids by orbital 
elements, predicted magnitude, location in the sky, etc.). </P>
