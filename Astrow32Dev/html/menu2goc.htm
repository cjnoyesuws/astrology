<P>Use this menu command to delete files from the file list. A file list is created whenever you start ASTRO and a record of every file created when you compile a horoscope chart. This file and the files it contains can be saved when you quit. You may wish to delete files, if you do not have much room on your disk, etc. Unless you do not tell ASTRO Not To the file list is entirely erased along with its contents when this program end.</P>

<P>If you have no files checked or<I> selected</I>, only the file that the highlight is on will be deleted, otherwise all the files that are checked or <I>selected</I> will be deleted.</P>

<P>You can also delete or kill a single file by highlighting that file and pressing DEL or Selecting Delete or Cut from the Edit menu.</P>
