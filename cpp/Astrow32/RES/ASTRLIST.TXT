A Brief History of Astrology Astrology : A Brief History
of Astrology Jail Maharaj (jaimaharaj@mcimail.com)
writes: CHINA: Aside from the Vedic records, perhaps the
oldest records of astrological practice are to be found
in China. The Chinese have been as scrupulous in
preserving their records as the Hindus of Bharat
(India.) CHALDEA: Although mention is made by later
writers of famous astrologers in Chaldea, particularly
Berosus, who lived about 3,000 BCE, no actual
manuscripts of Berosus are available if indeed such
writings were ever made. But, undoubtedly the science of
astrology was practiced at a very remote period in the
history of the Chaldeans and the astrology of the Greeks
and Romans was directly derived from this source.

excerpt:
Skeptic's Dictionary 3 astrology A form of divination
based on the theory that movements of the celestial
bodies (stars, planets, sun, and moon) influence human
affairs and determine events. The Chaldaeans and
Assyrians, believing all events to be predetermined,
developed a nondeistic system of divination. The spread
of astrological practice was arrested by the rise of
Christianity, with its emphasis on divine intervention
and free will; but in the Renaissance astrology regained
popularity, in part due to rekindled interest in science
and astronomy. Christian theologians warred against
astrology, and in 1585 Pope Sixtus V condemned it. At
the same time the work of Kepler and others undermined
astrology's tenets, although the practice has continued.

RESOURCE GUIDE TO THE HISTORY OF ASTROLOGY Lester J.
Ness 161 Holly Lane Beale AFB, CA 95903 lness@netcom.com
1993 COMPILER'S NOTE This work is a guide to literature
on the history of astrology . It is nearly unique: of
the thousands of titles published each year  on
astrology, few are concerned with the history of the
discipline. The same is true of the common reference
works on occult practices. This work is related to
research I did on my doctoral dissertation on the zodiac
mosaics found in ancient Israeli synagogues. Inevitably,
it reflects my own interests in the religious and
artistic aspects of astrology. It is aimed at upper-
classmen and -women, and beginning graduate students,
and is the sort of reference work I wished for when I
began my academic career

SIMPLIFIED BASIC VEDIC ASTROLOGY CONCEPTS The basic
concepts are quite simple, really, but the following
description may gain as well as suffer from the
simplicity contained therein. In astrology we are
concerned with the observation of the positions of
certain bodies and points of significance in space in
relation to the Earth, as well as to each other, and
with the correspondences between these relative
positions and the events which occur on Earth and
elsewhere. To make the necessary observations and to
translate them into terms of correspondence with events
occurring on earth, both physical and subtle, our
ancient sages evolved a rational procedure that is based
on five main factors: * The Zodiac - A fixed background
