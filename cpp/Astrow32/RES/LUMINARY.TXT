                      What Is Luminary?

Luminary is a platform-independent, easy-to-use, and powerful library of
astronomy code in the C language. The library is highly structured. At the
highest (and easiest) level, you can calculate the coordinates for all the
planets with two calls.


                  Luminarys Principle Features

->	Calculates the positions of the Sun, Moon, and planets
->	Calculates positions of asteroids using osculating elements
->	Calculates comet positions using osculating elements
->	Comes with data for dozens of asteroids you can add to the library
->	Works for a span of 16000+ years from 4713 BC to 12000 AD
->	Is remarkably accurate for planetary calculations
		to 0.1" of arc for a span of 200 years
		to 15" of arc for a span of 6000 years
		to 30" of arc for a span of 8000 years
->	Returns results in six coordinate systems
		spherical heliocentric celestial (ecliptic)
		rectilinear heliocentric celestial
		spherical geocentric celestial
		rectilinear geocentric celestial
		spherical geocentric equatorial (right ascension/declination)
		spherical topocentric horizontal (altitude/azimuth)
->	Calculates true geometric positions
->	Calculates apparent positions for any combination of
		light time
		annual aberration
		nutation
		parallax
		refraction
->	Calculates all positions for the equinox of date
->	Calculates apparent visual magnitude for any body
->	Calculates apparent phase for any body
->	Calculates apparent diameter for planets
->	Calculates data for solar and lunar eclipses
->	Calculates positions of the 4 classical moons of Jupiter
		low accuracy - suitable for identifying which is which
		high accuracy - to time mutual events, transits, occultations
->	Calculates the orientation of the rings of Saturn
->	Has sophisticated time management to
		convert among standard, universal, julian, and dynamical time
		step through time at any rate, forward or backward
->	Comes with a comprehensive printed manual explaining the code
->	Is platform independent
->	Is strict ANSI C compliant
->	Is very fast - on some machines 0.01 second to calculate positions for all theplanets


 
                           How Fast Is Fast?

On a Power Macintosh 7100, a PowerPC 601 chip, using a fast math library
with unoptimized code, Luminary can calculate the positions of all the
planets and moon in all six coordinate systems in 0.01 second. Performance
will vary greatly depending upon the platform and compiler. On a Mac Quadra
700 using a Motorola 68040 at 25 mHz with math co-processor, the same
calculation takes 0.3 seconds.


                             Ordering Info

Luminary is not a consumer-oriented end-user astronomy program like Voyager
II, Distant Suns, Red Shift, or similar programs. Luminary is a set of tools
you can use to write your own software for solar system calculations, for
personal use or commercial gain.

There are no licensing fees with Luminary. You are free to include
Luminary-based object code in your programs without further payment to
Nebula. The only limitation is that you cannot distribute the source code
under any circumstances, even if your program is free. If you create a
program for distribution, please give credit in your documentation or
somewhere clearly visible in your program stating that you use the Luminary
code library, and that it is  1994 by Nebula Inc, All Rights Reserved, and
give our address: P.O. Box 191, Cumberland Ctr., ME 04021.

Luminary is available from Nebula for $495.00. You receive a 3.5" disk (Mac
or DOS) containing the source code and related files, and a 50-page manual
detailing all aspects of the library and how to use it.

If you are interested, but would like to know more, contact Nebula. For
$5.00 we'll ship you the manual and you can read all about it. If you decide
to purchase, we'll credit the price of the manual.
