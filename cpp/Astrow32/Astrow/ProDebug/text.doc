\f1\ql\fs24 Your Ascendant is Scorpio, 17.10 Degrees, and is in Direct

\f1\ql\fs24       Your intense behavior conceals the fact that you are a

tendencies, but the influence of Neptune may disrupt the 
higher goals of the Scorpio Expression. This decan is 
sub-ruled by Neptune, the planetary ruler of Pisces.\par

\f1\ql\fs24          You are a well-balanced person. You are well aware 
of your inner needs and you know how to take care of them. 
You are patient and can endure unpleasant circumstances, 
yet you have the courage to change them forcefully when 
necessary. Although you enjoy being the center of stage, it 
doesn't bother you to step aside to let someone else have a 
turn in the limelight. Your occasional bouts with 
depression don't bother you because you know that you will 
soon be back up there, feeling like a million.\par

\f1\ql\fs24          You approach life with high hopes. That's because 
you have developed a deep sense of self-worth, in spite of 
those occasional setbacks. You make decisions quickly and 
easily, especially when you follow your hunches rather than 
try to think things out logically. You have many creative 
urges but need considerable freedom to express them. The 
slightest restraints turn you off. You are always on the 
lookout for opportunities to lead, and often find them. Your 
willing followers are attracted by your exuberance and 
enthusiasm for new projects. However when you undertake a 
new project, you should finish it quickly. Otherwise you will 
lose interest and go looking for new challenges. You can 
easily become a central figure in a large organization 
since higher ups quickly recognize your leadership 
potential.\par

\f1\ql\fs24          You are a self motivated, ambitious, and enterprising 
realist who likes nothing better than to be in on the 
ground floor of a promising new business or organization. Your 
ability to act decisively stems from your quick appreciation 
for the potentials for action in any situation. You become 
impatient with delays imposed by what you feel to be 
needless concerns for the future consequences of your 
decisions. Your boundless ambitions are often frustrated by 
your restless nature and inability to cope with unexpected 
problems.            If almost all your planets are in the 
cardinal signs, you should guard against butting into 
everyone's business. By this time, you should recognize 
that you are not welcome.\par

\f1\ql\fs24          You are energetic in your pursuit of a wide range of 
interests. These interests are usually focused on social 
issues rather than personal pursuits. In fact, you are 
annoyingly aloof when it comes to personal relationships. 
It is difficult for you to share your inner life with 
someone else. That's because you are hardly aware of your 
own inner feelings. They are less interesting to you than 
what's going on out in the "real world". That's where the 
action is, and that's where you want to be! Your interest and 
dedication come to life when you can link up with some 
global cause. You thrive on the causes that promise to bring 
about the greatest social change. Chances are good that you 
are into energy, ecology, and the nuclear threat. Your 
involvements will not include antisocial behavior since you 
have a strong need to maintain the appearance of 
respectability. That goes hand in hand with your need for 
recognition of your natural leadership abilities. These 
leadership abilities are often recognized and rewarded soon 
after you have had the opportunity prove them.\par
\f1\ql\fs24          Your self-starting impulses often lead you into 
starting more than you can handle. That's a price you are 
willing to pay in your efforts to become master of your own 
destiny.\par
\f1\ql\fs24       You willingly accept, and often seek out, the advice and 
opinions of others in matters affecting your own life. Not 
that you can't decide these things for yourself. It's just 
that your own happiness depends on meeting the needs and 
wishes of others in your life who you care about. It isn't 
important to you that you choose your own path. This need for 
approval makes you vulnerable to a few who might see it as 
an opportunity for taking advantage of your need to please 
them. Fortunately, experience teaches you how to protect 
yourself from such abuse. More often, your cooperative 
nature brings you the well-earned rewards of success in both 
personal and business relationships.\par

\f1\ql\fs24          You are a chameleon, who can change colors to suit 
any surrounding or circumstance. Your motto is "I'd rather 
switch than fight." The ease with which you recall past 
experiences, gives you the distinct advantage of having all 
that experience at your fingertips, for solving present 
problems. At best, your friends think you of you as 
versatile, or perhaps changeable. At worst, they are more 
likely to call you unreliable. With your intellectual 
outlook, you prefer to think of yourself as flexible and 
resourceful. You have the knack for keeping things moving and 
stepping in to resolve difficulties as they arise between 
others. That's because of your inner need for a harmonious 
environment.\par
\f1\ql\fs24       Your only problem is that you find it hard to accept 
responsibility. Perhaps that's because you spend so much 
time enjoying memories of the past, you resent the time it 
would take to deal with the problems of the future.\par
