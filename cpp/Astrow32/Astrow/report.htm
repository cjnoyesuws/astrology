You find yourself facing one crisis after another, each of which you overcome with hard work.<P><P><B>Count of Planets in Genders:</B><P>Masculine Signs      9       Feminine Signs        1<P>         You are an outgoing person with a charming gift of gab. You are a self-starter, concerned with setting things right in the world. However, you are more an idealist than a practical doer. You depend on your charm and humor to win people over, rather than on persuasive arguments. Your motives are seldom in question, but your impractical approaches are. That's unfortunate, since you have the ability to take something from the planning stage to its completion. The problem is you don't usually stay with a project long enough to finish it. Your love of excitement and new challenges lead you to other things, often to the edge of exhaustion. Take the time to recharge your batteries. It would help even more if you learned to tap your normally neglected emotional reserves. That would really bring you into balance and bring stability to your daily living.<P><P><B>Count of Planets in Elements:</B><P>Fire Signs           4       Earth Signs           1<P>Air Signs            5       Water Signs           0<P>         You are an "idea person" who focuses on the larger things in life. Your agile mind scoops up thousands of facts and quickly sorts the significant from the insignificant. You're on the lookout for anything that can make life more meaningful to mankind. (You're less concerned about any one person.) You can think fast and clearly. You can organize your life down to the smallest detail. Once you understand something, (and you can understand almost anything!) you take special joy in communicating it to anyone who will listen. Objectivity is your passion. You use your mind like a surgeon's knife to cut away any irrelevancy. Unfortunately, many of your "irrelevancies" are the emotional enrichments of life. Emotions only confuse you; especially your own.<P>      Your friends find your objectivity more like indifference or detachment You often have to think and rethink something again and again, before you are willing to make a commitment. Yet you work well with all sorts of people because you don't get involved with them.<P>         You approach life with high hopes. That's because you have developed a deep sense of self-worth, in spite of those occasional setbacks. You make decisions quickly and easily, especially when you follow your hunches rather than try to think things out logically. You have many creative urges but need considerable freedom to express them. The slightest restraints turn you off. You are always on the lookout for opportunities to lead, and often find them. Your willing followers are attracted by your exuberance and enthusiasm for new projects. However when you undertake a new project, you should finish it quickly. Otherwise you will lose interest and go looking for new challenges. You can easily become a central figure in a large organization since higher ups quickly recognize your leadership potential.<P><P><B>Count of Signs in Qualities:</B><P>Cardinal Signs       4       Fixed Signs           5<P>Mutable Signs        1<P>         You have already chosen your goal in life. The problem is that your goal is so far in the future, you can't see how your daily struggles are getting you any closer to it. Since you are a "one-idea person" with an intense sense of purpose. You have to guard against falling into the stubborn pursuit of a "one-track life". On the positive side, you have enormous powers of concentration and will stay with something long after everyone else has given up and left the scene. Yours is the kind of determination that often seeks out some cause to support. The more noble the cause, the more you enjoy your self-sacrifice, dedication, and perseverance in support of that cause. Choose your causes wisely.<P>         You are a self motivated, ambitious, and enterprising realist who likes nothing better than to be in on the ground floor of a promising new business or organization. Your ability to act decisively stems from your quick appreciation for the potentials for action in any situation. You become impatient with delays imposed by what you feel to be needless concerns for the future consequences of your decisions. Your boundless ambitions are often frustrated by your restless nature and inability to cope with unexpected problems.            If almost all your planets are in the cardinal signs, you should guard against butting into everyone's business. By this time, you should recognize that you are not welcome.<P><P><B>Count of Houses:</B><P>House #1             3       House #2              1<P>House #3             0       House #4              0<P>House #5             0       House #6              0<P>House #7             0       House #8              0<P>House #9             1       House #10             1<P>House #11            3       House #12             1<P><P><B>Count of Planets in Various Hemispheres:</B><P>North Houses         4       South Houses          6<P>East Houses          9       West Houses           1<P>         You insist on making your own choices about your goals and your life styles. Your determination and stubborn self-reliance often lead you into confrontations with parents, higher-ups, and friends who feel that they know better what you should do and how you should do it. You need your freedom of choice more than you need their approval. Above all, you must feel that you are in control of your circumstances.<P><P><B>Count of Functional Houses:</B><P>Individual Houses    4       Relative Houses       3<P>Temporal Houses      2       Terminal Houses       1<P>         You are a well-balanced person. Enthusiasm will be tempered by practicality, and logic will be tempered by emotions. You can get very excited about planning a vacation, or you can cancel a vacation without remorse if it becomes necessary to do so. You think things out carefully before coming to a decision; but you can also make a decision impulsively. You live your life in the here-and-now, unconcerned by memories of the past or warnings of the future.<P><P><B>Count of Modal Houses:</B><P>Cadent Houses        2       Angular Houses        5<P>Succedent Houses     4<P>         You are well balanced between getting things started, helping to keep them going or keeping them on the track against changing circumstances. You can come up with new ideas, yet you do not become so attached to them that you can't change your mind in the face of new circumstances or unforeseen problems. You can be just as effective as a team player or a team player or a team leader. You handle both positions equally well.<P><P><B>Count of Aspects:</B><P>Conjunct             8       Sextile              11<P>Trine                7       Opposed               2<P>Squared              7       Semisextile           0<P>Sesquiquadrate       0       Semisquare            0<P>Quincunx             0       Biquintile            0<P>Quintile             0       Tredecile             0<P>Decile               0<P>         You are an idea person who enjoys the intellectual stimulation of social relationships. You love to tell your ideas to anyone who will listen.<P></DIV><DIV><CENTER>
