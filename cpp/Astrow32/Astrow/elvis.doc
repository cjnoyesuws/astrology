\f1\ql\fs24          You are serious about everything you do. You are 
motivated by your need for security. You make sure that 
nothing threatens your income, family or possessions. You are 
a defender of the traditional values such as honesty, hard 
work, and responsible behavior. You need to be under some 
sort of stress before you can feel comfortable. That's 
because you thrive on hard work that can show off your 
abilities in getting things done under difficult 
circumstances. You are also good at carrying emotional 
burdens without whimpering.\par
\f1\ql\fs24       You don't go out of your way to change the world 
around you. Instead, you bide your time and wait for the 
right moment to try to improve matters, avoiding 
confrontations wherever possible. However if pressed, you 
can assert yourself with surprising vigor. You get your 
strength from the faith in your beliefs, and from your 
determination to endure any difficulty if it will help you 
to achieve your goals in life.\par

it becomes necessary to do so. You think things out 
carefully before coming to a decision; but you can also 
make a decision impulsively. You live your life in the

\f1\ql\fs24          You are a self motivated, ambitious, and enterprising 
realist who likes nothing better than to be in on the 
ground floor of a promising new business or organization. Your 
ability to act decisively stems from your quick appreciation 
for the potentials for action in any situation. You become 
impatient with delays imposed by what you feel to be 
needless concerns for the future consequences of your 
decisions. Your boundless ambitions are often frustrated by 
your restless nature and inability to cope with unexpected 
problems.            If almost all your planets are in the 
cardinal signs, you should guard against butting into 
everyone's business. By this time, you should recognize 
that you are not welcome.\par

\f1\ql\fs24          You are a balanced person. You don't find it hard 
to live with the conditions imposed on you by others. Then, 
too, you don't find it hard to change things when you feel 
that others are crowding you. You like your privacy, but you 
also need friends. You can enjoy yourself by being alone 
with a good book, or by working on a committee to raise 
funds for a worthy cause. You have learned how to go along 
with the wishes of others without sacrificing your own best 
interests.\par

\f1\ql\fs24          You are a well-balanced person. Enthusiasm will be 
tempered by practicality, and logic will be tempered by 
emotions. You can get very excited about planning a 
vacation, or you can cancel a vacation without remorse if 
it becomes necessary to do so. You think things out 
carefully before coming to a decision; but you can also 
make a decision impulsively. You live your life in the 
here-and-now, unconcerned by memories of the past or 
warnings of the future.\par

\f1\ql\fs24          You are well balanced between getting things 
started, helping to keep them going or keeping them on the 
track against changing circumstances. You can come up with 
new ideas, yet you do not become so attached to them that 
you can't change your mind in the face of new circumstances 
or unforeseen problems. You can be just as effective as a 
team player or a team player or a team leader. You handle 
both positions equally well.\par
