          motion.
                Your feelings run deep, especially with family ties. Your

          unless you get out with others. You like to work, but only
          if it is creative, rather than physical work.

          Your Moon is Squared to Mercury With an Orb of 4 Degrees.

          motion.

          decisions more because they are yours than because of the
          merits they might have on their own.
          
          It is in the Third Decan.
                The natural expression of Aries is expanded by the

          aloof Aquarian personality. this decan also promotes a

          sign Libra.

          Less Important.
                Your activities focus on the pursuit of an ambitious

          friendly relationships that can help your career interests
          and social status. You also may marry for this reason as
          well. You are apt to be a social climber, and become
          connected romantically with people who are in the "Right

          Your Jupiter is on the cusp Between Libra and Scorpio, 29.7
          Degrees, and is in Retrograde motion.
          Libra:
                You try your very best to spread yourself like oil
          over troubled waters. You want recognition for your virtues
          and often get it in the praises of your virtuous mate. You
          thrive in harmonious surroundings.
          Scorpio:
                You have a need to extend your control over the people
          in your life. Perhaps that's because you are involved with
          them in financial and legal matters. You have a passion for
          possessions, and for physical pleasures.
                As a result of Jupiter having been in retrograde
          motion, you are slow to make changes in your life style and
          cautious about accepting the newest codes of morality. Your
          strong moral convictions are rooted in the deep soil of your
          impressionable childhood.
          
          It is in the Third Decan. This is an Anaretic Degree
          indicating an Urgent need to work with the energies of
          this planet.
                This tends to give the sign Libra flexibility and
          versatility but can also add restlessness. It also sharpens
          the intellectual expression. This decan is sub-ruled by the
          planet Mercury, the planetary ruler of the sign Gemini.
          
          Your Jupiter is in the Fifth House, Not On House Cusp and
          Less Important.
                Your activities center on bringing education and
          pleasure to others, especially the children. Your romantic
          interests often involve someone with money or position. You
          play the stock market, or you gamble.
          
          ASPECTS:
          
          Your Jupiter is Sextile to Saturn With an Orb of 3 Degrees.

          ages. You exercise a strong influence on other people.
          
          Your Jupiter is Conjunct to North Node With an Orb of 3
          Degrees.
                This suggests that your personal values and
          philosophies pretty much conform to those of society in
          general. You are in tune with current trends and this is an
          advantage to you.
          
          Your Jupiter is Opposition to South Node With an Orb of 3
          Degrees.
                See the house that Jupiter and Your North Node are in
          to determine your capacity to overcome the limitations of your
          South Node.
          
          
          YOUR SATURN:
          
          Your Saturn is Sagittarius, 25.35 Degrees, and is in Direct
          motion.

          views. You direct all your efforts toward the improvement of
          your mind and your work habits. You aim at achieving some
          sort of intellectual distinction.
          
          It is in the Third Decan.
                The influence of the Sun, ruler of the sign Leo,
          strengthens Sagittarius' vitality, adds strength, patience
          and generally stabilizes it more than the first two decans.
          The sub-ruler of this decan, the Sun also tempers the
          Sagittarian tendency toward restlessness.
          
          Your Saturn is in the Seventh House, Not On House Cusp and
          Less Important.
                You have a deep sense of responsibility in meeting your
          commitments to other people. You work hard, holding up your
          share of the load in any partnership. You marry someone
          like yourself, late in life.
          
          ASPECTS:
          
          Your Saturn is Trine to Pluto With an Orb of 4 Degrees.

          Your Saturn is Squared to Part of Fortune With an Orb of 3
          Degrees.
                This aspect brings you misfortune associated with your
          Part of Fortune, rather than benefits. This also produces
          barriers to the benefits you seek.
          
          
          YOUR URANUS:
          
          Your Uranus is Leo, 7.33 Degrees, and is in Retrograde
          motion.
                You can be creative in either the arts or sciences. You
          create your own social, moral, and professional standards,
          which you then insist that everyone else must follow. Your
          belief in free love is one example.
                As a result of Uranus having been in retrograde
          motion, you spend a lot of time reviewing the past, rather
          than dealing with the present or the future. You feel that
          the only way you can make progress is to avoid making the
          same mistakes over again. Your past often does make an
          unexpected reappearance.
          
          It is in the First Decan.
                This decan intensifies the strength and power in Leo's
          natural tendencies. This decan is ruled and sub-ruled by the
          Sun, ruler of Leo.
          
          Your Uranus is in the Third House, Not On House Cusp and
          Less Important.
                You seem to have a psychic antenna that keeps you well
          informed about what's going on. You are interested in the
          unusual--especially occult teachings. You have a strong
          need for intellectual friends.
          
          ASPECTS:
          
          Your Uranus is Squared to Neptune With an Orb of 3 Degrees.
                You seem to be continually confused by the surrounding
          turmoil of the times. You are a pioneer.
          
          Your Uranus is Squared to North Node With an Orb of 4
          Degrees.
                You have a total disrespect for the customs and
          traditions of society, particularly any mores and rules and
          regulations. You attract society's radicals along with
          sudden reversals of fortune.
          
          Your Uranus is Squared to South Node With an Orb of 4
          Degrees.
                You scorn society's rules and customs and may embrace
          all the limitations that your South Node gives you as a
          form of that rebellion.
          
          Your Uranus is Squared to Vertex With an Orb of 0 Degrees
          (Exact Orb).
          
          
          YOUR NEPTUNE:
          
          Your Neptune is Scorpio, 4.4 Degrees, and is in Retrograde
          motion.
                This generation must resolve the struggle between its
          strong sexual desires and its equally strong need for
          spiritual regeneration.
                As a result of Neptune having been in retrograde
          motion, you are keenly aware of your intuitive insights and
          introspections. You are willing to reconsider your basic
          beliefs on the basis of a continuous evaluation of your
          innermost feelings.
          
          It is in the First Decan.
                This decan tends to the most powerful of all the three
          decans of Scorpio since it is unchanged by other
          sub-rulers. It tends to bring out the harshest, most

          world leadership--especially on the complex problems caused
          by the boom of nuclear power.
                As a result of Pluto having been in retrograde motion,

          Your South Node is in the Twelfth House, On House Cusp and
          More Important.
                You need to be able to sacrifice your own wants and

                Provided your Part of Fortune is not afflicted, areas

                This suggests that you have a need to protect your

          emergencies, and the rest may be spent.
          
          Your Third House Cusp is 26 Cancer.
                This gives you "Emotional Color". Your mind is
          imaginative, and your dreams, feelings and memories color your
          mind. You have excellent powers of recall, though do not
          like to study unless you are "In the Mood". You are
          emotionally attached to your family and friendly to
          neighbors.
          
          Your Fourth House Cusp is 19 Leo.

          Your Fifth House Cusp is 19 Virgo.
                You have a low-key love life, and are picky and
          discriminating in your relationships, setting extremely
          high standards. You don't like to gamble. Usually you don't
          have many children but are fussy and particular with those
          you do.
          
          Your Sixth House Cusp is 1 on the Cusp Between Scorpio and
          Libra.
          Scorpio:
                You are a hard-worker, and tend to overwork yourself.
          You don't care to stop till the job is done. You will work
          long and hard toward that end. You need to be careful
          lifting as you are susceptible to hernias, or other
          problems that affect the groin and genital region.
          Libra:
                Unless you have a harmonious work environment and a
          compatible job atmosphere, you can't do your job
          efficiently, or will not be satisfied with it. You are
          susceptible to nervous stress and emotional disturbances. You
          may also have weak kidneys, or be prone to urinary tract

          Your Seventh House Cusp is 15 Sagittarius.
                You seek partners who share your ethical and moral
          values. You will tend to have more than one relationship or
          marriage, and will tend to seek partners with entirely
          different backgrounds, who may be foreigners.
          
          Your Eighth House Cusp is 6 Capricorn.
                This reduces your prospects of inheriting assets, and
          any benefits you do have will be tied up by others. Your
          joint finances will do well. Your partner may be tight with
          the purse-strings.
          
          Your Ninth House Cusp is 26 Capricorn.
                You tend to be rather narrow-minded where morals and
          ethics are concerned, and tend to follow orthodox beliefs and
          religions. You do not deal with your in-laws on a personal
          basis, but have no problem doing business with them.

                You have a strong interest in other-worldly or "New

          "Intellectual" and you tend to do well in group
          situations.
          
          Your Eleventh House Cusp is 19 Pisces.
                You may make friends with people because you feel
          sorry for them. You don't always use the best judgement when
          choosing your fiends. They often aren't loyal to you. You
          may have an interest in mystical organizations.
          
          Your Twelfth House Cusp is 1 on the Cusp Between Taurus and
          Aries.
          Taurus:
                Your anxieties are primarily financial ones. Your love
          of possessions and comforts may be your undoing.
          Aries:
                Your anxieties are caused by your impetuous actions. You
          create problems and enemies because of your argumentative,
          headstrong, combative actions or behavior.
          
          Your Scout Planet is Venus.
                   You are diplomatic in your dealings with friends and
          business associates. These dealings focus on improving
          family relationships, business partnerships, or contractual
          arrangements. You always seem to attract people who can
          make favorable changes in your surroundings or
          circumstances.

          Masculine Signs      7       Feminine Signs        3
                   You are an outgoing person with a charming gift of
          gab. You are a self-starter, concerned with setting things
          right in the world. However, you are more an idealist than
          a practical doer. You depend on your charm and humor to win
          people over, rather than on persuasive arguments. Your
          motives are seldom in question, but your impractical
          approaches are. That's unfortunate, since you have the
          ability to take something from the planning stage to its
          completion. The problem is you don't usually stay with a
          project long enough to finish it. Your love of excitement and
          new challenges lead you to other things, often to the edge
          of exhaustion. Take the time to recharge your batteries. It
          would help even more if you learned to tap your normally
          neglected emotional reserves. That would really bring you
          into balance and bring stability to your daily living.

                   You are a well-balanced person. Enthusiasm will be
          tempered by practicality, and logic will be tempered by
          emotions. You can get very excited about planning a
          vacation, or you can cancel a vacation without remorse if
          it becomes necessary to do so. You think things out
          carefully before coming to a decision; but you can also
          make a decision impulsively. You live your life in the
          here-and-now, unconcerned by memories of the past or
          warnings of the future.

                   You are well balanced between getting things
          started, helping to keep them going or keeping them on the
          track against changing circumstances. You can come up with
          new ideas, yet you do not become so attached to them that
          you can't change your mind in the face of new circumstances
          or unforeseen problems. You can be just as effective as a
          team player or a team player or a team leader. You handle
          both positions equally well.

                   You are a balanced person. You don't find it hard
          to live with the conditions imposed on you by others. Then,
          too, you don't find it hard to change things when you feel
          that others are crowding you. You like your privacy, but you
          also need friends. You can enjoy yourself by being alone
          with a good book, or by working on a committee to raise
          funds for a worthy cause. You have learned how to go along
          with the wishes of others without sacrificing your own best
          interests.

                   You are a well-balanced person. Enthusiasm will be
          tempered by practicality, and logic will be tempered by
          emotions. You can get very excited about planning a
          vacation, or you can cancel a vacation without remorse if
          it becomes necessary to do so. You think things out
          carefully before coming to a decision; but you can also
          make a decision impulsively. You live your life in the
          here-and-now, unconcerned by memories of the past or
          warnings of the future.

          Cadent Houses        4       Angular Houses        3
          Succedent Houses     4
                   You are well balanced between getting things
          started, helping to keep them going or keeping them on the
          track against changing circumstances. You can come up with
          new ideas, yet you do not become so attached to them that
          you can't change your mind in the face of new circumstances
          or unforeseen problems. You can be just as effective as a
          team player or a team player or a team leader. You handle
          both positions equally well.
