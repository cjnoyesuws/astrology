It is difficult for you to share your inner life with someone else. That's because you are hardly aware of your own inner feelings. They are less interesting to you than what's going on out in the "real world". That's where the action is, and that's where you want to be! Your interest and dedication come to life when you can link up with some global cause. You thrive on the causes that promise to bring about the greatest social change. Chances are good that you are into energy, ecology, and the nuclear threat. Your involvements will not include antisocial behavior since you have a strong need to maintain the appearance of respectability. That goes hand in hand with your need for recognition of your natural leadership abilities. These leadership abilities are often recognized and rewarded soon after you have had the opportunity prove them.<P>         You insist on making your own choices about your goals and your life styles. Your determination and stubborn self-reliance often lead you into confrontations with parents, higher-ups, and friends who feel that they know better what you should do and how you should do it. You need your freedom of choice more than you need their approval. Above all, you must feel that you are in control of your circumstances.<P><P><B>Count of Functional Houses:</B><P>Individual Houses    0       Relative Houses       4<P>Temporal Houses      3       Terminal Houses       3<P>         You are a well-balanced person. Enthusiasm will be tempered by practicality, and logic will be tempered by emotions. You can get very excited about planning a vacation, or you can cancel a vacation without remorse if it becomes necessary to do so. You think things out carefully before coming to a decision; but you can also make a decision impulsively. You live your life in the here-and-now, unconcerned by memories of the past or warnings of the future.<P><P><B>Count of Modal Houses:</B><P>Cadent Houses        5       Angular Houses        2<P>Succedent Houses     4<P>         You are well balanced between getting things started, helping to keep them going or keeping them on the track against changing circumstances. You can come up with new ideas, yet you do not become so attached to them that you can't change your mind in the face of new circumstances or unforeseen problems. You can be just as effective as a team player or a team player or a team leader. You handle both positions equally well.<P><P><B>Count of Aspects:</B><P>Conjunct             3       Sextile               7<P>Trine                6       Opposed               2<P>Squared              6       Semisextile           0<P>Sesquiquadrate       0       Semisquare            0<P>Quincunx             2       Biquintile            0<P>Quintile             0       Tredecile             0<P>Decile               0<P></DIV></BODY>
