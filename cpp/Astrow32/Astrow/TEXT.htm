You are well aware of your inner needs and you know how to take care of them. You are patient and can endure unpleasant circumstances, yet you have the courage to change them forcefully when necessary. Although you enjoy being the center of stage, it doesn't bother you to step aside to let someone else have a turn in the limelight. Your occasional bouts with depression don't bother you because you know that you will soon be back up there, feeling like a million.<P><P><B>Count of Planets in Elements:</B><P>Fire Signs           2       Earth Signs           3<P>Air Signs            3       Water Signs           2<P>         You are a well-balanced person. Enthusiasm will be tempered by practicality, and logic will be tempered by emotions. You can get very excited about planning a vacation, or you can cancel a vacation without remorse if it becomes necessary to do so. You think things out carefully before coming to a decision; but you can also make a decision impulsively. You live your life in the here-and-now, unconcerned by memories of the past or warnings of the future.<P><P><B>Count of Signs in Qualities:</B><P>Cardinal Signs       4       Fixed Signs           2<P>Mutable Signs        4<P>         You are well balanced between getting things started, helping to keep them going or keeping them on the track against changing circumstances. You can come up with new ideas, yet you do not become so attached to them that you can't change your mind in the face of new circumstances or unforeseen problems. You can be just as effective as a team player or a team player or a team leader. You handle both positions equally well.<P><P><B>Count of Houses:</B><P>House #1             0       House #2              2<P>House #3             3       House #4              2<P>House #5             0       House #6              1<P>House #7             0       House #8              0<P>House #9             0       House #10             0<P>House #11            1       House #12             1<P><P><B>Count of Planets in Various Hemispheres:</B><P>North Houses         8       South Houses          2<P>East Houses          7       West Houses           3<P>         You are energetic in your pursuit of a wide range of interests. These interests are usually focused on social issues rather than personal pursuits. In fact, you are annoyingly aloof when it comes to personal relationships. It is difficult for you to share your inner life with someone else. That's because you are hardly aware of your own inner feelings. They are less interesting to you than what's going on out in the "real world". That's where the action is, and that's where you want to be! Your interest and dedication come to life when you can link up with some global cause. You thrive on the causes that promise to bring about the greatest social change. Chances are good that you are into energy, ecology, and the nuclear threat. Your involvements will not include antisocial behavior since you have a strong need to maintain the appearance of respectability. That goes hand in hand with your need for recognition of your natural leadership abilities. These leadership abilities are often recognized and rewarded soon after you have had the opportunity prove them.<P>         You insist on making your own choices about your goals and your life styles. Your determination and stubborn self-reliance often lead you into confrontations with parents, higher-ups, and friends who feel that they know better what you should do and how you should do it. You need your freedom of choice more than you need their approval. Above all, you must feel that you are in control of your circumstances.<P><P><B>Count of Functional Houses:</B><P>Individual Houses    0       Relative Houses       4<P>Temporal Houses      3       Terminal Houses       3<P>         You are a well-balanced person.
