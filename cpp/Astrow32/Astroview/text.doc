\f1\ql\fs24          You are an outgoing person with a charming gift of 
gab. You are a self-starter, concerned with setting things 
right in the world. However, you are more an idealist than 
a practical doer. You depend on your charm and humor to win 
people over, rather than on persuasive arguments. Your 
motives are seldom in question, but your impractical 
approaches are. That's unfortunate, since you have the 
ability to take something from the planning stage to its 
completion. The problem is you don't usually stay with a 
project long enough to finish it. Your love of excitement and 
new challenges lead you to other things, often to the edge 
of exhaustion. Take the time to recharge your batteries. It 
would help even more if you learned to tap your normally 
neglected emotional reserves. That would really bring you 
into balance and bring stability to your daily living.\par

\f1\ql\fs24          You are an "idea person" who focuses on the larger 
things in life. Your agile mind scoops up thousands of 
facts and quickly sorts the significant from the 
insignificant. You're on the lookout for anything that can 
make life more meaningful to mankind. (You're less 
concerned about any one person.) You can think fast and 
clearly. You can organize your life down to the smallest 
detail. Once you understand something, (and you can 
understand almost anything!) you take special joy in 
communicating it to anyone who will listen. Objectivity is 
your passion. You use your mind like a surgeon's knife to 
cut away any irrelevancy. Unfortunately, many of your 
"irrelevancies" are the emotional enrichments of life. 
Emotions only confuse you; especially your own.\par
\f1\ql\fs24       Your friends find your objectivity more like 
indifference or detachment You often have to think and 
rethink something again and again, before you are willing 
to make a commitment. Yet you work well with all sorts of 
people because you don't get involved with them.\par
\f1\ql\fs24          You approach life with high hopes. That's because 
you have developed a deep sense of self-worth, in spite of 
those occasional setbacks. You make decisions quickly and 
easily, especially when you follow your hunches rather than 
try to think things out logically. You have many creative 
urges but need considerable freedom to express them. The 
slightest restraints turn you off. You are always on the 
lookout for opportunities to lead, and often find them. Your 
willing followers are attracted by your exuberance and 
enthusiasm for new projects. However when you undertake a 
new project, you should finish it quickly. Otherwise you will 
lose interest and go looking for new challenges. You can 
easily become a central figure in a large organization 
since higher ups quickly recognize your leadership 
potential.\par

\f1\ql\fs24          You have already chosen your goal in life. The 
problem is that your goal is so far in the future, you 
can't see how your daily struggles are getting you any 
closer to it. Since you are a "one-idea person" with an 
intense sense of purpose. You have to guard against falling 
into the stubborn pursuit of a "one-track life". On the 
positive side, you have enormous powers of concentration and 
will stay with something long after everyone else has given 
up and left the scene. Yours is the kind of determination 
that often seeks out some cause to support. The more noble 
the cause, the more you enjoy your self-sacrifice, 
dedication, and perseverance in support of that cause. 
Choose your causes wisely.\par
\f1\ql\fs24          You are a self motivated, ambitious, and enterprising 
realist who likes nothing better than to be in on the 
ground floor of a promising new business or organization. Your 
ability to act decisively stems from your quick appreciation 
for the potentials for action in any situation. You become 
impatient with delays imposed by what you feel to be 
needless concerns for the future consequences of your 
decisions. Your boundless ambitions are often frustrated by 
your restless nature and inability to cope with unexpected 
problems.            If almost all your planets are in the 
cardinal signs, you should guard against butting into 
everyone's business. By this time, you should recognize 
that you are not welcome.\par

\f1\ql\fs24          You insist on making your own choices about your 
goals and your life styles. Your determination and stubborn 
self-reliance often lead you into confrontations with 
parents, higher-ups, and friends who feel that they know 
better what you should do and how you should do it. You 
need your freedom of choice more than you need their 
approval. Above all, you must feel that you are in control 
of your circumstances.\par

\f1\ql\fs24          You are a well-balanced person. Enthusiasm will be 
tempered by practicality, and logic will be tempered by 
emotions. You can get very excited about planning a 
vacation, or you can cancel a vacation without remorse if 
it becomes necessary to do so. You think things out 
carefully before coming to a decision; but you can also 
make a decision impulsively. You live your life in the 
here-and-now, unconcerned by memories of the past or 
warnings of the future.\par

\f1\ql\fs24          You are well balanced between getting things 
started, helping to keep them going or keeping them on the 
track against changing circumstances. You can come up with 
new ideas, yet you do not become so attached to them that 
you can't change your mind in the face of new circumstances 
or unforeseen problems. You can be just as effective as a 
team player or a team player or a team leader. You handle 
both positions equally well.\par
