     WHAT IS SHAREWARE?
	Shareware is a means of marketing Software at a reasonable price.
     Developers of Software use Shareware to distribute their products
     using Shareware because it provides a minimal advertising cost.
     Advertising costs money. In order to market a program on a retail
     basis, a developer typically needs to sell a minimum of 5000 copies
     a month. Shareware circumvents this somewhat and helps provide
     you the customer with a good value at a much lower price  than
     you would receive from a commercial source.
	In order for shareware to work, If users are actually using 
     a product, they must register. Developers can't continue to develop
     and improve products if customers don't register and upgrade.
     Running a small business costs money. If you enjoy using a shareware
     product, either register it or tell the developer what they can
     do to provide a product that you will register. If you don't register
     remove the product from your system and don't  use it. 
	Shareware is not Free or Public Domain Software. You can't expect
     timely upgrades and fixes from Free or Public Domain Software.
     With a Product like these fonts, if you register, and you there
     are problems I will do everything I can to see that the product
     works well for you. I will provide you as much assistance as I
     can. This unfortunately costs money. I can't do it without your
     registration.
