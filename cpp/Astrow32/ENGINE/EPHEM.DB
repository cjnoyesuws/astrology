* ephem database.
*
* these are sorted for easy reading but they don't have to be in any order.
* things will run faster if you put the objects you use nearer the top.
*
* elliptical format (e < 1):
*	i = inclination, degrees
*	O = longitude of ascending node, degrees
*	o = argument of perihelion, degrees
*	a = mean distance (aka semi-major axis), AU
*	n = daily motion, degrees per day
*	e = eccentricity,
*	M = mean anomaly (ie, degrees from perihelion),
*	E = epoch date (ie, time of M),
*	D = the equinox year (ie, time of i/O/o).
*	g/k or H/G = magnitude model
*	s = angular size at 1 AU, arc seconds, optional
