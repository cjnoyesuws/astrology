	  Introduction

	  MAKE is a 'free' utility and this is it's documentation file.

	  This program was originally based on Neil Russell's public domain
	  make utility, but has been extensively rewritten  and enhanced by
	  many authors.

	  MAKE	is distributed	without any  warranty of  any kind,  either
	  expressed  or implied.  Neither  the authors nor  anyone else who
	  has been involved in the creation, production or delivery of this
	  program shall  be liable for any  direct, indirect, consequential
	  or incidental damages arising out of the use	of, or inability to
	  use, this program.


	  Recognition:

	  This version	of MAKE is  based on the  public domain  version of
	  make, and  includes ideas presented  in a version  called PAMAKE.
	  The  latter  is  distributed	 with  Roundhill  Computer  Systems
	  software. This version claims  no rights to the MAKE	source code
	  or to the  name 'MAKE'.  Permission is granted  to reproduce  the
	  text	of this file  in connection with  personal use	of MAKE. We
	  respectfully	ask  that if you  modify the MAKE  source code	and
	  then republish  the source   code, you should  use a name  other
	  than	'MAKE' to identify it, and write your own documentation for
	  it. Alternatively, if you tell us about changes and  enhancements
	  you make, we would be pleased to consider incorporating them them
	  in a	future version.  That way everyone can benefit from all the
	  enhancements.


	  History

	  Being a  user of a  public domain  version of a  MAKE utility,  I
	  found  that it required some enhancements and bug fixes. When the
	  source was found to not be available, a public domain MAKE source
	  was  revised	along with  substantial  enhancements  to meet	the
	  minimum requirements for  my own development.  The result is	the
	  enclosed  MAKE program  which is  now included  with the  library
	  source for DOS. It is easily extended to OS2.

	  The  source code for Neil Russell's make  is available on BIX and
	  elsewhere,  both in its original form and as modified by Cheyenne
	  Wills and others.

	  The  source code for MAKE is included with this documentation, as
	  well	as a  utility 'LIBMAKE'  which  can be  used  to build  and
	  maintain Microsoft Library  or Zortech files.

	  What's New


	  This version fixes a	problem involving the recursive application
	  of dependency rules.	 Earlier versions would not apply  a second
	  dependency rule  automatically if multiple steps  were needed to
	  build  a target when only the first  file was present. Also added
	  is the '%exit'  special command, and the $(HOME)  builtin macro,
	  and a default of 'MAKE' for the $(MAKE) macro.

	  This version added a test for selected DOS internal commands, and
	  also command-line redirection. The -t option now creates a  'zero
	  byte directory entry'  target file,  if one is  not present.  The
	  objective being to permit the erasure of unnecessary object files
	  that	have been inserted into libraries.   We also added a SIGINT
	  trap. In addition, we modified the source so that we could  build
	  a 'family' (DOS and OS/2 combined) version, if necessary.

	  This version has enhancements  to the touch command, where,  if a
	  target does  not exist, a zero length file will be created in the
	  directory.

	  A  libmake.exe programme  was  included to  help build  microsoft
	  libraries.  It is used to  build the library	containing the make
	  objects.

	  The principal  enhancements incorporated  include the ability  to
	  set  DOS  environment  variables  from  within  MAKE	(which	are
	  required  from time to  time to handle  the different environment
	  settings of the many compilers), the ability:

		  to support development  when the source files  are in one
		  subdirectory and the objects and libraries are in others,


		  for MAKE include files and conditional execution

		  and a 'local input file' feature.

	  Some of  the features  require considerable  changes	to the	way
	  inference rules and special macros  are processed, but the result
	  is as compatible with Unix make as possible.

	  The 'local input file'  allows link and library command  files to
	  be set up dynamically  (and macro-expanded). This feature ensures
	  that all the	commands to build a project can  be included in one

	  makefile,  and thus  avoids having  to use  the DOS  echo command
	  (with a consequent reduction in efficiency).



	  Operation of Make

	  The operation of MAKE is closely modelled on the Unix 'make', and
	  in  particular is completely different  from the operation of the
	  make	utility  currently  supplied  with Microsoft  C  5.1.  MAKE
	  processing is tree structured,  and requires the principal target
	  to be listed first (or named	on the command line). In  execution
	  the  algorithm   recursively	tests  all  the     other  makefile
	  statements to determine automatically the particular	commands to
	  execute and the appropriate sequence.


	  Using MAKE

	  The command line syntax can be determined by executing:

		      MAKE -?

	  and the built-in macros, rules and suffixes by executing:

		      MAKE -f - -p <NUL

	  This	documentation  file  contains  full  details  of  the  MAKE
	  enhancements, and a brief summary of the  principles of operation
	  of a traditional  Unix make utility.	For a  full explanation of
	  the  operation of a  'make' you are referred  to a standard Unix
	  reference manual.  The  principal  make  features  not  currently
	  included in MAKE are the following:

	      - The $% special macro [library member name]
	      - The D  and F  special macro  modifiers [directory part	and
		file part]
	      - SCCS file and archive file support
	      - The -k and -b command-line switches
	      - There are no built-in macros such as CC=cc

	  MAKE special features

	  Enhancements in MAKE and differences from Unix 'make' include the
	  following:

	      - If a macro name begins with '+' then the '+' is removed and
		the macro  definition is  also placed in  the 'environment'
		for the  commands executed  by MAKE.   This feature  allows
		setting of  command paths, include file  paths, and special
		compiler   environment	variable   switches  automatically,
		instead of in an AUTOEXEC file or manually.

	      - Nested	macros	 in  the  environment  variable  value	are
		expanded at the time it is defined,  that is once, when the
		macro  is first processed.  If the  macro is also used as a
		regular macro any nested macros are expanded in  the normal
		way at	the time the macro  is used.   Macro names starting
		with '+' are  placed in the  execution environment even  if
		the -e switch prevents	their overriding a macro definition
		of   the  same	 name  already	 present  in   the  initial
		environment. if a  macro name  begins with '+'  the '+'  is
		ignored.

	      - Whitespace  is deleted	between  a macro  definition and  a
		comment  starting with	#.  This makes	it  much easier  to
		document makefiles.  Many Unix 'makes' do not do this.

	      - If a  command line starts with '+' then it is invoked using
		a  'system' function  instead  of  being spawned  directly.
		This  enables internal DOS commands  to be used.   The most
		often  used  DOS  and	OS/2  commands	are  also  detected
		automatically.	Currently this list includes:

		  "COPY","DEL","ECHO","ERASE","FOR","IF","MD","MKDIR","RD",
		  "REN","RENAME","RMDIR", "TYPE",

	  If you  need other DOS  commands, you  should either	use '+'  or
	  modify the source.  No DOS error code is available from  commands
	  executed through  the 'system' function, but OS/2  does pass back
	  error information.

	      - MAKE handles redirection for commands not  executed through
		'system'. The  symbols processed are "<",  ">", ">>", "2>",
		and "2>>". The  handle '2' refers to stderr.   Redirection
		of  both stdout and stderr, requires the use of a different
		filename for each file.  Note  that the use the '+' flag or
		one of	the automatically recognised DOS  or OS/2 commands,

		will cause MAKE to pass the command to the shell to process
		the redirection.


	      - The Unix  'make' only invokes the  commands associated with
		inference rules (eg with ".c.obj:") either when no specific
		dependency  appears in	the makefile  or when  the specific
		dependency exactly  matches what  would have  been inferred
		(e.g. "foo.obj:  foo.c") and no command  lines follow. MAKE
		extends the  'exact match' to allow  the inferred dependent
		name  to be a substring of the actual dependent name. This
		may make little sense without an example, but its effect is
		to allow  inference rules and corresponding  commands to be
		used even if the  source file is in a  different directory.
		Here is the example:

		      .c.obj:
			      cl /c $<;

		      MYSRC=c:\mysrc

		      foo.exe: foo1.obj foo2.obj
			      link

		      foo1.obj: $(MYSRC)\foo1.c

		The  Unix make	would execute  the cl  command for  foo2 if
	  foo2.c is  in the current directory, but would not execute cl for
	  foo1 even if foo1.c  is in the mysrc directory. MAKE will execute
	  the cl command automatically for both.  Note: case is significant
	  in determining whether a substring condition exists.

	      - The  $< $*  $@ and  $? macros  are always  evaluated before
		processing a command. In Unix make the first two only apply
		to  inference rules  and the  second  two only	to explicit
		dependency  lists.   The  $<  evaluates  to   the  complete
		'inferred'  filename if  an inference  rule has  been used.
		Otherwise (i.e. if an explicit command line was supplied or
		if no inference  rule could  be made) $<  evaluates to	the
		FIRST  dependency file	 listed  for this  target. $*  on a
		command line  always evaluates to  the filename part  of $<
		(i.e. less the extension).

	      - The special  macro $-  indicates, when found  on a  command
		line, that the immediately  following lines in the makefile
		are  to  be  written  to   a  temporary  file  (with  macro
		expansion) immediately	prior  to executing  the  command.

		This 'local input file' must  be terminated in the makefile
		by a line containing the character '<' in the first column.
		The $- macro  is	expanded  on the command line,	and
		defaults  to   a  value  of  'TEMP_LIF.TMP'   (but  can  be
		redefined). This macro	expansion is used as  the file name
		for  the  temporary file,  so take  care  that it  does not
		designate  a file requires retaining. If  $- evaluates to a
		null string, the default  filename TEMP_LIF.TMP is used for
		the  file name but the macro expansion	is left as null.  A
		typical command  line could  be 'LIB  @$-' which  tells LIB
		that  the  filename  TEMP_LIF.TMP  contains  the  librarian
		commands. The  temporary file is deleted  after the command
		has finished, and is not created  if the -n switch has been
		given.	  The string  '\n' in  a local  input file  line is
		converted into an extra newline.

	      - A  special macro '$\' has  been added which  evaluates to a
		backslash ('\'). You  should use this  macro to separate  a
		path and  a filename  in your  makefiles, instead  of hard-
		coding	a  backslash.  The  reason this  macro	is  created
		internally  is that  it  is difficult  to  define it  in  a
		makefile (think about how you would do it, and remember the
		line continuation feature).

	      -  A special  expansion of the  macro '$*' is  performed when
		the macro  occurs  in  a  dependency  name.  The  macro  is
		expanded  to  the base	name  of the  current  target. This
		allows makefiles of the form:

			OBJS= obj1.obj obj2.obj ...
			$(OBJS): \other\$*.c hdr.h
				cl -Fo$@ $<

		In the above example, $* evaluates to 'obj1' for the target
	  'obj1.obj', and to 'obj2' for the target 'obj2.obj' etc. When the
	  command is  actually performed,  '$<' expands  to '\other\obj1.c'
	  etc.

	      -  A line starting (in  column 1) with the string:   #include
		is a  signal to  the input  routine to	attempt to open  an
		'include'  file.  The whole  of the remainder  of the input
		line  is taken to  be the  file name,  which should  NOT be
		enclosed in double quote characters or angle brackets. MAKE
		does not search  multiple directories for the file:   since
		the makefile specifies all such directories, we assume that
		at the	very   least  you know where the  include files are
		when  you write  the makefile.	For convenience,  MAKE does

		accept	and expand  any macros	in the	filename.   Include
		files may be nested to a depth of four levels. The #include
		line  may be  placed  anywhere	in  the input  file  except
		immediately following a  line ending  in '\'.   If the  '#'
		does  not start in  column 1 it  will be taken	as a normal
		comment. If you need  to start a line with  '#include' (for
		example  in  a	local input  file)  the  use  of an  escape
		('\#include') will allow this.

	      - Conditional  processing  of  makefile lines  is  supported.
		Special 'comment' lines starting '#if', '#ifn', '#else' and
		'#endif' have the effect you would expect on the lines they
		enclose.   The syntax for the statement on '#if' and '#ifn'
		lines  is  exactly  the  same as  a  macro  definition	and
		currently  you	can only  test macro  values, and  only for
		equality.   Note  that a  single equals sign is  used as in
		the following example:

			#if M=s
			MODEL=small
			#endif

		The macro name on the left of the equality statement should
	  NOT have a '$' in front of it.  This conditional processing takes
	  place when the makefile is first read in, and a macro name on the
	  left	of  the  conditional  takes  its  value  at  the  time	the
	  conditional is processed.  The right side  of the conditional  is
	  macro-expanded before the test. Conditionals	may be nested up to
	  ten levels deep.

	      - Conditional  processing  of  command  lines  is  supported.
		Special command lines  starting '%if', '%ifn',  '%else' and
		'%endif'  (following  a tab)    have the  effect  you would
		expect on  the command lines  they enclose.  In addition  a
		'%set'  command  line  can  be  used  to  specify  a  macro
		definition  which is made dynamically.	 The syntax for the
		statement on	     '%if' and '%ifn' lines is  exactly the
		same  as a macro definition and currently you can only test
		macro  values, and only for  equality.	Note  that a single
		equals sign is used as in the following example:

			%if @=foo.obj
			%set CFLAGS=$(SPECIALFLAGS)
			%else
			%set CFLAGS=$(DEFAULTFLAGS)
			%endif

		The macro name on the left of the equality statement should
	  NOT have a '$' in front of it.  This conditional processing takes
	  place when the  command lines are executed,  and a macro name  on
	  the  left of	the  conditional takes	its value  at the  time the
	  conditional is  processed. The right	side of the  conditional is
	  macro-expanded before the test. Conditionals may  be nested up to
	  ten levels deep.   Note  that each set  of commands is  processed
	  separately and  must	be completed  with  the correct  number  of
	  '%endif' statements,  or  the  processing of  the  MAKE  will  be
	  terminated.  Macros defined with  the '%set' command stay defined
	  for  any further commands executed  in the MAKE  run. The special
	  command '%exit' causes the make to be terminated immediately.  If
	  a numeric value follows (e.g. '%exit  1') then it will be used as
	  the exit code.

	      -  Special code has been inserted to handle the  expansion of
		'$$'  in a  macro.    Many  Unix  'make'  programs  do  not
		correctly handle file names  including a '$' character when
		the needed '$$' is in a macro which gets expanded more than
		once.  The internal  macro '$=$' which is normally  used to
		expand the '$$'  has been changed  in MAKE to set  the high
		bit  of the  replacement character,  and the high  bits are
		then stripped  off before  the result  is actually  used by
		MAKE.  If you have  the MAKE  source code, and if you never
		need the '$' in your makefiles, you  can save a little time
		and memory by  undefining the  symbol DOLLAR in  H.H.	The
		'$$' macro  call will  still work, but  only if  it is  not
		expanded more than once.

	      - The  '-t'  switch for  'touch'  has  been incorporated  for
		MSDOS. After one has safely built a library, one can delete
		the obj files and follow up by reinvoking MAKE with  the -t
		option. Zero length files will be  placed in the directory,
		and no excess disk space consumed. The timestamps  of other
		files will be revised to reflect the new situation.

	  'Make' Overview

	  For the benefit of users who are unfamiliar with make  and do not
	  have access to Unix manuals, a very brief description of the MAKE
	  features follows. These  features are common to  most full 'make'
	  implementations.

	  Command-line syntax:

	      MAKE [-f filename] [-deinpqrst] [macro=value ...] [target(s) ...]

	      Command-line  switches  can  be  combined in  one  string  or
	  entered  as individual tokens  in any  order and  intermixed with
	  macro  definitions. If the -f switch is given, the next following
	  command line token  will be taken as the file  name.	If entered,
	  target names must follow all the switches and macro definitions.

	  Command-line switches:

	      -f filename   Name of makefile (default is "makefile", "-" is
			    stdin)
	      -d	    Print  timestamps of files as they are analysed

	      -e	    Environment has priority over makefile macros
	      -i	    Ignore all exit status values
	      -n	    Execute no commands except $(MAKE)
	      -p	    Print all macros and targets
	      -q	    Question  if target  is up-to-date,  exit(1) if
			    not
	      -r	    Do not use the inbuilt rules
	      -s	    Make silently
	      -t	    Touch files instead of making them
	      -v	    Prints version information

	  The MAKEFLAGS environment variable:

		The  environment  variable MAKEFLAGS  can contain  a string
	  consisting  of '-' followed by  any of the  flags 'einqrst' which
	  are processed  as if	they  appeared on  the	command line.	 An
	  environment variable MAKEFLAGS containing the current settings of
	  these flags is always passed on to commands executed by MAKE.

	  Macros:

		On  the command  line,	or in  the  makefile, you  can	use
	  "str1=str2"  to define  a macro.   Macros  are expanded  with the
	  syntax "$(str1)".   The parentheses may be  omitted if str1 is  a
	  single character.  Case is significant.  If str1 is preceded by a
	  '+' it  is put in the DOS or OS/2 environment as "STR1=str2", for
	  the duration of the make execution only. Any existing environment
	  variables at	the start  of the  MAKE run  are also available  as
	  macros.

	  Macro redefinition and priority:

		A  macro given	on the	command line  cannot  be redefined.
	  Macros defined  in the  makefile  override environment  variables
	  with the  same name unless  the '-e'  flag is given,  but do  not

	  override the environment  used for the commands  executed by make
	  unless they are preceded by a '+'.

	  Macro value substitution:

	  Macros in the makefile may also be expanded using the syntax:

		    $(str1:subst1=subst2)

		The above expression that  the macro named 'string1' should
	  be  expanded, and that in  the expansion text  all occurrences of
	  'subst1' should be  replaced by 'subst2'.  If the equals sign and
	  second substitution string are omitted then 'subst1' is deleted.

	  Target - Dependency - Commands specification:

	  The basic syntax in the makefile is as follows:

		      target:  dep1 dep2 dep3 ...
			command1
			command2
			...

		Command  lines must  start with  a tab.   Target/Dependency
	  lines may  be continued by  placing '\' at  the end of  the line.
	  Comments start with '#' and continue to the  end of the line.  If
	  '#' is required in a makefile line it must be escaped as '\#'.

		MAKE executes the commands to make the target if any of the
	  dependent files have a later timestamp than the target, or if the
	  target is not found. If  no targets are specified on the  command
	  line MAKE  builds the first  target encountered in  the makefile.
	  The makefile is analysed recursively so  that any dependencies of
	  a target are also built in the correct sequence.

		In a line not beginning with a tab, the first ':' character
	  delimits the target name.  A colon in a target name (e.g. a drive
	  separator)  can  be escaped  as '\:'.    Colons are  permitted in
	  dependancy names.

	  Multiple command sequences:

		Multiple target:dependancy sets may be defined for a single
	  target, but normally	a target  may only be  associated with	one
	  list	of  commands.  If  the	target	and  dependancy  names	are
	  separated with '::' instead  of ':', however, each such  line may
	  be followed by a set of commands.  The first such set of commands

	  is executed for which a dependancy name is later than the target.
	  This	allows	for  alternatative  methods of	building  a  target
	  depending on what files have changed.


	  Special command prefixes:

		If a  command is  preceded by a  special prefix  character,
	  special  processing occurs.	Multiple  prefix characters  may be
	  used.  The characters are as follows:

		  + execute this command through the command processor
		  - ignore error exit codes for this command
		  @ execute this command silently

		If you need  to use a command which starts  with one of the
	  special prefix  characters,  you can	escape	it with  '\'.  This
	  feature may be  needed to run  a VMS command	file using the	'@'
	  command.


	  Inference rules:

		The special  target ".suff1.suff2" specifies how  to make a
	  file with suffix suff2  from a file with a matching  basename and
	  with the suffix suff1.

		As  explained above, MAKE  interprets 'a matching basename'
	  to mean that	the target  basename should be	a substring of	the
	  dependency file basename.

		When  the dependency file is  in the same  directory as the
	  target, it  is unnecessary  to specify the  dependency explicitly
	  because MAKE	will use the  builtin or supplied  inference rules
	  and suffixes list (see below) to determine the correct command to
	  execute.

	  Special macros:

		$<    Expands to the main  dependency filename which caused
		      the current actions to be carried out (see above).

		$*    On a  command line, expands to  the basename, without
		      the suffix, of $<.   In a dependency, expands  to the
		      basename, without the suffix,  of the current target.
		      In  the  latter  case,  the  expanded  name  will  be
		      different for each of multiple targets.

		$@    The current target

		$?    The list (whitespace-separated)  of dependency  names
		      which are out-of-date with respect to the target

		$-    Defaults	to expand  to TEMP_LIF.TMP.   In  a command
		      line,  indicates that the immediately following lines
		      up to and not including  the first line starting with
		      '<' in column 1 are to be placed in a file which will
		      have a name which  is the expansion of the  $- macro.
		      This   file  will   be  created	immediately  before
		      executing the  command in  which the $-  appears, and
		      deleted afterwards.  If the $- macro  evaluates to a
		      null  string, the  default name TEMP_LIF.TMP  is used
		      for the file name instead of the macro expansion.

		$(MAKE)
		      If specified in a command,  causes the command to  be
		      executed	even if '-n' has been given.  This allows a
		      'supermake'  to call  nested MAKE  commands, passing
		      the  '-n' flag through MAKEFLAGS. $(MAKE) defaults to
		      a value of 'make'.

		$(HOME)
		      The current working drive and directory when the make
		      started.

	  Special targets:

		.PRECIOUS
		      Dependents of  this target  will not be  removed when
		      the  make is interrupted.
		      Break (control-C) and command errors cause the target
		      being worked on to be deleted if it's been changed
		      unless it's a prerequisite of the target `.PRECIOUS'.
		      For example:

				   .PRECIOUS: nerase.exe

		.SILENT
		      Same as -s option

		.IGNORE
		     Commands returning nonzero status (ie. the errorlevel)
		     cause MAKE to terminate unless the special target
		     `.IGNORE' is in the makefile. or the command begins
		     with a - hypen).  The `-i' option gives the same effect.

		.DEFAULT
		      Used  to specify commands to be used when a target is
		      to  be built  and  no explicit  commands or  built-in
		      rules can be applied.

		.SUFFIXES
		      The dependants of  .SUFFIXES are	suffixes which	are
		      applied  in turn to  the basename until  one is found
		      for  which an inference rule is present for which the
		      created file  exists. If dependants of  .SUFFIXES are
		      present they are added to the built-in suffixes list;
		      otherwise the list is cleared.


	  Built-in rules:

		MAKE  has a number  of built-in  rules for  creating object
	  files  from  various different  types of  source  file.   All are
	  implemented using macros (eg the  command for  .c.obj:  is  $(CC)
	  $(CFLAGS) $(CFILES) ).  Unlike Unix make, the  definitions of the
	  macros  such as O and CC are	not built-in and must be defined in
	  the makefile.   This allows for the variety of command and suffix
	  names found outside  the Unix  environment. There is	a rule	for
	  code generation  for suffixes such as .c, .cpp .asm .pas and .for
	  .


	  Performance issues:

		The number of suffixes	directly affects the performance of
	  MAKE: To speed up  MAKE, you can remove the  unnecessary suffixes
	  by   specifying an empty '.SUFFIXES' and then one containing only
	  .c (and .asm, if needed).  For example:

		  .SUFFIXES:		  # clear suffixes list
