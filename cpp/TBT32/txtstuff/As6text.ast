       You should not have much trouble in getting along with your companion and what differences you have, you should be able to work out.

       You will have to work very hard to maintain a relationship. The reason is that the dominantly masculine person's aggressive behavior will threaten and harass the reserved, security-motivated feminine personality.
# C_SAME_GEN C_GENDER
       You share the same viewpoint and approach to life. Initially this could give you a strong feeling of compatibility. However, you will soon feel a need for the kind of stimulation that comes from defending mildly different points of view. You will have to turn to someone else to meet that need.
