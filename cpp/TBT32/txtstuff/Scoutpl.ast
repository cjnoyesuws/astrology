{Your Scout Planet:}

     The "Scout Planet" in your natal horoscope is the last planet to come up over the eastern horizon before the Sun comes up. That relationship makes it important because transiting planets will <meet and activate> the Scout Planet just before they meet and activate your natal Sun.
