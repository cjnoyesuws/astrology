# S_TRINE AS_SUMMARY

# BALANCED EL_SUMMARY
         You are a well-balanced person. Enthusiasm will be tempered by practicality, and logic will be tempered by emotions. You can get very excited about planning a vacation, or you can cancel a vacation without remorse if it becomes necessary to do so. You think things out carefully before coming to a decision; but you can also make a decision impulsively. You live your life in the here-and-now, unconcerned by memories of the past or warnings of the future.
# FIRE EL_SUMMARY
         You approach life with high hopes. That's because you have developed a deep sense of self-worth, in spite of those occasional setbacks. You make decisions quickly and easily, especially when you follow your hunches rather than try to think things out logically. You have many creative urges but need considerable freedom to express them. The slightest restraints turn you off. You are always on the lookout for opportunities to lead, and often find them. Your willing followers are attracted by your exuberance and enthusiasm for new projects. However when you undertake a new project, you should finish it quickly. Otherwise you will lose interest and go looking for new challenges. You can easily become a central figure in a large organization since higher ups quickly recognize your leadership potential.
# EARTH EL_SUMMARY
         You are dependable, strong-willed, and would rather keep to yourself. Yours is always the practical approach in getting things done. You may be a slow starter, but you stick to something until you can show concrete results. You usually do. Your great skill at managing money and other physical resources makes you an excellent executive. You could do very well at organizing and operating a large enterprise. A major problem would be in overcoming your stubborn resistance to change. Friends consider you to be conservative; others say you are obstinate. In either case, you resist change until you can see it make sense based on practical considerations. You always find a way to accumulate what you need for physical needs. Too often they become more important than your other needs. You take excellent care of your body and personal surroundings.
# AIR EL_SUMMARY
         You are an "idea person" who focuses on the larger things in life. Your agile mind scoops up thousands of facts and quickly sorts the significant from the insignificant. You're on the lookout for anything that can make life more meaningful to mankind. (You're less concerned about any one person.) You can think fast and clearly. You can organize your life down to the smallest detail. Once you understand something, (and you can understand almost anything!) you take special joy in communicating it to anyone who will listen. Objectivity is your passion. You use your mind like a surgeon's knife to cut away any irrelevancy. Unfortunately, many of your "irrelevancies" are the emotional enrichments of life. Emotions only confuse you; especially your own.
         Your friends find your objectivity more like indifference or detachment You often have to think and rethink something again and again, before you are willing to make a commitment. Yet you work well with all sorts of people because you don't get involved with them.
# WATER EL_SUMMARY
         You are especially sensitive to everything going on around you. You seem to be able to tune in to what people are thinking or feeling. You also seem to know what's going to happen next, like when the phone is about to ring. Your strongest feelings are about your family and home. Too often you take on the moods and feelings of those around you, leading to confusion and feelings of insecurity. For your own sense of purpose in life, you have to guard against developing a dependence on others. You spend too much time remembering the past. That's because you want to ignore the stressful present and the fearful future. You are always on the lookout for opportunities to use your active imagination. You love to design party settings, or decorate your home. You would thrive in a job where you had to create a new ad campaign, designing a store window or a landscape, or help in restoring a colonial village.
         Most of your decisions are based on hunches and feelings rather than logical considerations. After you make up your decision, you are never quite sure it was the right one.
# BALANCED GE_SUMMARY
         You are a well-balanced person. You are well aware of your inner needs and you know how to take care of them. You are patient and can endure unpleasant circumstances, yet you have the courage to change them forcefully when necessary. Although you enjoy being the center of stage, it doesn't bother you to step aside to let someone else have a turn in the limelight. Your occasional bouts with depression don't bother you because you know that you will soon be back up there, feeling like a million.
# MASCULINE GE_SUMMARY
         You are an outgoing person with a charming gift of gab. You are a self-starter, concerned with setting things right in the world. However, you are more an idealist than a practical doer. You depend on your charm and humor to win people over, rather than on persuasive arguments. Your motives are seldom in question, but your impractical approaches are. That's unfortunate, since you have the ability to take something from the planning stage to its completion. The problem is you don't usually stay with a project long enough to finish it. Your love of excitement and new challenges lead you to other things, often to the edge of exhaustion. Take the time to recharge your batteries. It would help even more if you learned to tap your normally neglected emotional reserves. That would really bring you into balance and bring stability to your daily living.
# FEMININE GE_SUMMARY
         You are serious about everything you do. You are motivated by your need for security. You make sure that nothing threatens your income, family or possessions. You are a defender of the traditional values such as honesty, hard work, and responsible behavior. You need to be under some sort of stress before you can feel comfortable. That's because you thrive on hard work that can show off your abilities in getting things done under difficult circumstances. You are also good at carrying emotional burdens without whimpering.
         You don't go out of your way to change the world around you. Instead, you bide your time and wait for the right moment to try to improve matters, avoiding confrontations wherever possible. However if pressed, you can assert yourself with surprising vigor. You get your strength from the faith in your beliefs, and from your determination to endure any difficulty if it will help you to achieve your goals in life.
# BALANCED QA_SUMMARY
         You are well balanced between getting things started, helping to keep them going or keeping them on the track against changing circumstances. You can come up with new ideas, yet you do not become so attached to them that you can't change your mind in the face of new circumstances or unforeseen problems.  You can be just as effective as a team player or a team player or a team leader. You handle both positions equally well.
# CARDINAL QA_SUMMARY
         You are a self motivated, ambitious, and enterprising realist who likes nothing better than to be in on the ground floor of a promising new business or organization. Your ability to act decisively stems from your quick appreciation for the potentials for action in any situation. You become impatient with delays imposed by what you feel to be needless concerns for the future consequences of your decisions. Your boundless ambitions are often frustrated by your restless nature and inability to cope with unexpected problems.              If almost all your planets are in the cardinal signs, you should guard against butting into everyone's business. By this time, you should recognize that you are not welcome.
# FIXED QA_SUMMARY
         You have already chosen your goal in life. The problem is that your goal is so far in the future, you can't see how your daily struggles are getting you any closer to it. Since you are a "one-idea person" with an intense sense of purpose. You have to guard against falling into the stubborn pursuit of a "one-track life". On the positive side, you have enormous powers of concentration and will stay with something long after everyone else has given up and left the scene. Yours is the kind of determination that often seeks out some cause to support. The more noble the cause, the more you enjoy your self-sacrifice, dedication, and perseverance in support of that cause. Choose your causes wisely.
# MUTABLE QA_SUMMARY
         You are a chameleon, who can change colors to suit any surrounding or circumstance. Your motto is "I'd rather switch than fight." The ease with which you recall past experiences, gives you the distinct advantage of having all that experience at your fingertips, for solving present problems. At best, your friends think you of you as versatile, or perhaps changeable. At worst, they are more likely to call you unreliable. With your intellectual outlook, you prefer to think of yourself as flexible and resourceful. You have the knack for keeping things moving and stepping in to resolve difficulties as they arise between others. That's because of your inner need for a harmonious environment.
         Your only problem is that you find it hard to accept responsibility. Perhaps that's because you spend so much time enjoying memories of the past, you resent the time it would take to deal with the problems of the future.
# BALANCED HE_SUMMARY
         You are a balanced person. You don't find it hard to live with the conditions imposed on you by others. Then, too, you don't find it hard to change things when you feel that others are crowding you. You like your privacy, but you also need friends. You can enjoy yourself by being alone with a good book, or by working on a committee to raise funds for a worthy cause. You have learned how to go along with the wishes of others without sacrificing your own best interests.
# EAST HE_SUMMARY
         You insist on making your own choices about your goals and your life styles. Your determination and stubborn self-reliance often lead you into confrontations with parents, higher-ups, and friends who feel that they know better what you should do and how you should do it. You need your freedom of choice more than you need their approval. Above all, you must feel that you are in control of your circumstances.
# WEST HE_SUMMARY
         Your self-starting impulses often lead you into starting more than you can handle. That's a price you are willing to pay in your efforts to become master of your own destiny.
         You willingly accept, and often seek out, the advice and opinions of others in matters affecting your own life. Not that you can't decide these things for yourself. It's just that your own happiness depends on meeting the needs and wishes of others in your life who you care about. It isn't important to you that you choose your own path. This need for approval makes you vulnerable to a few who might see it as an opportunity for taking advantage of your need to please them. Fortunately, experience teaches you how to protect yourself from such abuse. More often, your cooperative nature brings you the well-earned rewards of success in both personal and business relationships.
# NORTH HE_SUMMARY
         You prefer to keep to yourself. You are happiest when you can attend to your own affairs without worrying about how your actions are going to affect the lives of those around you. This leads you into a narrow range of interests centered on domestic matters. Your friends think of you as an introvert leading a life of self-imposed loneliness. Little do they know that you prefer your loneliness to the hassles of making connections to a more social life style. You do your best work when you work behind the scenes. The limelight turns you off.
         You deal with the world strictly based on your "gut feelings". That becomes a problem because your feelings are often thrown into confusion by sudden changes in your circumstances. That's why you find yourself in those gloomy moods so often. You will have to learn how to turn to others for help in overcoming these bouts with the blues. You can become more sociable without losing your privacy.
# SOUTH HE_SUMMARY
         You are energetic in your pursuit of a wide range of interests. These interests are usually focused on social issues rather than personal pursuits. In fact, you are annoyingly aloof when it comes to personal relationships. It is difficult for you to share your inner life with someone else. That's because you are hardly aware of your own inner feelings. They are less interesting to you than what's going on out in the "real world". That's where the action is, and that's where you want to be! Your interest and dedication come to life when you can link up with some global cause. You thrive on the causes that promise to bring about the greatest social change. Chances are good that you are into energy, ecology, and the nuclear threat. Your involvements will not include antisocial behavior since you have a strong need to maintain the appearance of respectability. That goes hand in hand with your need for recognition of your natural leadership abilities. These leadership abilities are often recognized and rewarded soon after you have had the opportunity prove them.
# MOON SC_PLANET
         You are especially responsive to the demands of practical matters at home or at business. You cope with problems by falling back onto the dependable values you learned during childhood. You also depend on your feelings and intuitions to help you in making important decisions
# MERCURY SC_PLANET
         You have to know everything about something before you can deal with it. So you study books and magazines and you talk to everyone, just to learn all you can. You are attentive to your appearance, and aware of the impression you make on others. You think things out carefully before you act.
# VENUS SC_PLANET
         You are diplomatic in your dealings with friends and business associates. These dealings focus on improving family relationships, business partnerships, or contractual arrangements. You always seem to attract people who can make favorable changes in your surroundings or circumstances.
# MARS SC_PLANET
         You meet your obstacles head on, and think nothing of challenging whoever stands in your way. You always manage to trigger a confrontation just before you feel it's time for a change in your life. You live your life fully aware of your personal ambitions and long-range goals.
# JUPITER SC_PLANET
         You express yourself through generous gestures that accurately reflect your compassion for other people. Your optimistic outlook gives others the confidence to join in your idealistic pursuits or your personal adventures. These usually involve creative efforts to expand the potential for a better life for all.
# SATURN SC_PLANET

# URANUS SC_PLANET
         You view the world from an unusual perspective. You have a link to hidden forces, which give you a deeper understanding of the mysteries of life. Unusual things happen to you, often very abruptly and unexpectedly. You have unique ways of getting things done, which causes people to think of you as being an eccentric.
# NEPTUNE SC_PLANET
         You are tuned in to the silent messages all around you. Fortunately, you have learned to respect and use your keen intuitions for sorting out the surrounding confusion. Your intuitive abilities can cause difficulties when you try to share your perceptions with others. Don't force your point.
# PLUTO SC_PLANET
         You like to do things secretly, not letting anyone know what you are up to. Perhaps that's because your own keen perceptions let you see into everyone else's hidden thoughts. You just don't want them to see into yours! You are always on the lookout for ways to improve yourself, or for that better idea that will spell success.
